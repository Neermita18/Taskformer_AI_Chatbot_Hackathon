I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!',\n",
       " 'output': 'Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.'}"

They are caused by a virus and are contagious.\", \"The image shows a close-up view of the skin on the neck of a person. There is a single, small, pink, dome-shaped bump (papule) present. The surrounding skin is wrinkled and shows signs of sun damage.\\n\\nPossible diseases associated with this image include:\\n\\n1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC):** BCCs are common skin cancers that often appear as pearly or waxy bumps. While the bump in the image is not classic for BCC, it's important to consider in the differential diagnosis.\\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC):** SCCs are another type of skin cancer that can present as scaly red patches, open sores, or elevated growths. While the bump in the image is not typical for SCC, it's worth considering, especially given the sun-damaged skin.\\n3. **Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC):** MCC is a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, firm, shiny nodule that may be flesh-colored or bluish-red. This should be considered, although the bump in the image doesn't perfectly match the typical appearance of MCC.\\n4. **Intradermal Nevus (Mole):** An intradermal nevus is a benign growth of melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) located in the deeper layers of the skin. These moles can sometimes appear as dome-shaped papules.\\n5. **Dermal Cyst:** A dermal cyst is a noncancerous, closed sac under the skin that contains fluid or semisolid material. They can sometimes appear as smooth, dome-shaped bumps.\\n6. **Other Benign Growths:** Other possibilities include a dermatofibroma (a benign fibrous growth) or a neurofibroma (a benign tumor of nerve tissue). \\n\", \"The image shows a close-up view of a hand with dark, hyperpigmented skin, particularly on the back of the hand and fingers. The skin appears thick and leathery with accentuated skin lines. \\n\\nGiven the provided information, the appearance of the hand could be attributed to various conditions.  Here are some possibilities:\\n\\n* **Acanthosis nigricans:** This condition causes velvety, darkened skin in body folds and creases. It's often associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and hormonal disorders. \\n* **Chronic eczema:** Long-term eczema can lead to skin thickening, discoloration (hyperpigmentation), and prominent skin markings.\\n* **Scleroderma:** While less likely, scleroderma can cause skin thickening and hardening. It can also affect other organs, including blood vessels and internal organs.\\n* **Drug-induced hyperpigmentation:** Certain medications can cause skin darkening as a side effect.\\n* **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation:** This is a common response to skin injury or inflammation where the skin produces excess melanin. \", \"The image shows the upper back of a person with several brown moles of varying sizes and shapes. Some moles are darker than others. \\n\\nPossible conditions associated with moles include:\\n\\n* **Normal moles (benign nevi):** Most moles are harmless and don't require treatment. \\n* **Atypical moles (dysplastic nevi):** These moles may have irregular features like uneven color, blurry borders, or larger size. They have a higher risk of becoming melanoma.\\n* **Melanoma:** This is the most serious type of skin cancer. It can develop from existing moles or appear as new spots.  \", 'The image shows an arm with a rash in the elbow crease. The rash is red, dry, and scaly. It could be a sign of several skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, or fungal infection.', \"The image shows multiple red and purple, fluid-filled blisters on a person's upper chest/shoulder area. Some blisters appear to be scabbed. This could be a symptom of several things such as: \\n\\n1. **Shingles (Herpes Zoster)**: Shingles often presents as a painful rash with blisters on one side of the body. \\n2. **Bullous impetigo**: A bacterial skin infection causing large, fluid-filled blisters. \\n3. **Allergic reaction**:  Certain allergies can manifest as blisters and skin irritation. \\n4. **Insect bites**:  Multiple bites can result in clustered, itchy blisters. \", 'This is an image of the left ear and the surrounding skin behind the ear of a fair-skinned individual. There is no obvious rash, discoloration, or other abnormalities of the skin. \\n', 'The image shows an arm with multiple excoriated papules and erosions. Possible diseases include: \\n* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):** A chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes itchy, red, and dry skin.  \\n* **Contact dermatitis:** An itchy rash caused by direct contact with an irritant or an allergic reaction to a substance. \\n* **Scabies:** A highly contagious skin infestation caused by a mite that burrows under the skin, leading to intense itching and a pimple-like rash. \\n* **Insect bites:**  Bites from insects like mosquitoes, bed bugs, or fleas can cause itchy, red bumps or welts.', \"The image shows a close-up view of the skin around a person's eye. There are numerous small, white or yellowish, firm bumps on the skin.  This appearance could indicate several conditions, including: \\n\\n* **Milia:** These are very common, harmless cysts filled with keratin. They are especially common in newborns but can occur at any age. \\n* **Syringomas:** These are benign sweat duct tumors that typically appear as small, flesh-colored or yellowish bumps. They often occur in clusters around the eyes.\\n* **Sebaceous hyperplasia:** This condition involves enlarged oil glands and can result in yellowish, dome-shaped bumps on the skin, often on the face.\\n* **Flat warts:**  These are small, flat-topped warts that can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face.\", \"The image shows a close-up view of a person's face, specifically around the mouth area. There is a noticeable depigmented patch of skin present. \\n\\nBased on the appearance, the most likely condition is **vitiligo**, which causes loss of skin color in patches. \\n\\nHowever, other possibilities to consider include:\\n\\n* **Pityriasis alba:** This condition often affects children and presents as light, scaly patches on the skin.\\n* **Tinea versicolor:** This fungal infection can cause lighter or darker patches on the skin.\\n* **Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation:** This can occur after skin injury or inflammation, leaving behind a lighter area of skin.\", \"The image shows a close-up view of the back of a person's hand with dark skin. The hand has numerous small, scattered, white papules.  This could indicate a few possible conditions:\\n\\n* **Lichen planus:**  Characterized by itchy, flat-topped, purplish papules. The appearance in this image could be a variant of lichen planus.\\n* **Molluscum contagiosum:**  Caused by a poxvirus, this condition presents with small, flesh-colored or pearly-white, dome-shaped papules, often with a central indentation.\\n* **Flat warts:**  These are small, smooth, flat-topped warts that are typically flesh-colored or slightly darker than the surrounding skin.\\n* **Folliculitis:** This is an inflammation of the hair follicles, which can cause small, white-headed pimples.\", 'The image shows a close-up view of a skin lesion. The lesion is a raised, flesh-colored papule with a smooth, pearly surface. There is some blood present on the lesion, indicating recent trauma or irritation. This could be due to a number of things, including scratching or picking at the lesion. \\n\\nGiven the appearance and characteristics, here are a few possibilities of what this skin lesion could be:\\n\\n* **Basal cell carcinoma:**  While basal cell carcinomas can sometimes bleed, they usually present with a pearly or waxy appearance, often with visible blood vessels. \\n* **Squamous cell carcinoma:** This type of skin cancer can also bleed and might appear as a firm, red nodule or a rough, scaly lesion. \\n* **Molluscum contagiosum:** This viral infection often presents as small, flesh-colored or pearly-white bumps with a central dimple.  \\n* **Skin tag (acrochordon):** Skin tags are harmless, flesh-colored growths that often occur in areas of friction, such as the neck, armpits, or groin. \\n* **Insect bite:** Some insect bites can cause red, swollen bumps that may bleed.', 'The image shows the back of a hand with multiple, well-defined, hypopigmented macules and patches. Some lesions are confluent and show fine scaling. The depigmentation is not complete, with some areas retaining a light brown pigmentation. \\n\\nPossible diagnoses include:\\n\\n* **Vitiligo:** An autoimmune disorder causing loss of skin pigmentation. \\n* **Pityriasis alba:** A common, benign skin condition characterized by hypopigmented patches, often occurring in children and adolescents. \\n* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):** A fungal infection that can cause hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches, often on the trunk and upper arms but can occur on the hands.\\n* **Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation:**  Lightening of the skin after inflammation or injury, such as eczema or burns.', 'The image shows a patch of hair loss on the scalp. This is a nonspecific finding and could be caused by a variety of conditions, including:\\n\\n* **Alopecia areata:** An autoimmune disorder that causes patchy hair loss. This is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the well-defined patch of hair loss.\\n* **Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp):** A fungal infection that can cause hair loss, scaling, and inflammation. \\n* **Trichotillomania:** A hair-pulling disorder that can lead to patchy hair loss.\\n* **Scarring alopecia:** A group of conditions that cause hair loss and scarring of the scalp.\\n* **Telogen effluvium:** A type of hair loss that occurs after a stressful event.', \"This image shows the inside of an ear canal with a dark, scaly lesion present. \\n\\nPossible diseases include:\\n\\n* **Otitis Externa (Swimmer's Ear):** This is an inflammation of the ear canal, often caused by infection. While this image doesn't show typical redness and swelling, some forms of otitis externa can present with scaling and debris.\\n* **Eczema:** This inflammatory skin condition can affect the ear canal, causing itching, redness, scaling, and cracking.\\n* **Psoriasis:** Another skin condition that can cause thick, scaly patches, although the appearance here isn't classic for psoriasis.\\n* **Fungal Infection (Otomycosis):**  The dark color and scaly appearance could indicate a fungal infection of the ear canal.\\n* **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** This common skin condition can cause flaky, white to yellowish scales, often on the scalp but it can affect areas like the ear canal. \\n* **Skin Cancer:** While less likely, any unusual lesion warrants investigation to rule out skin cancer. \", 'The image shows a single, well-defined, erythematous plaque on the leg.  The lesion is slightly raised and scaly.  Possible diagnoses include:\\n\\n* **Nummular eczema:** This is a common type of eczema that causes coin-shaped, itchy, and scaly patches of skin. \\n* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** This is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause red, ring-shaped rashes.\\n* **Psoriasis:**  This is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause thick, scaly, red patches of skin.\\n* **Drug eruption:** Some medications can cause a variety of skin reactions, including red, itchy rashes.']\n"
