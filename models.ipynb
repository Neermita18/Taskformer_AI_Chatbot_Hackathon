(Also called: Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000369.htm\\nAnswer: PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:  - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs   - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women   Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.   In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.   These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances.  Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease\\nAnswer: Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver.  Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture.  The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease\\nAnswer: Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease.  Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation.  Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.  Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: Is polycystic kidney disease inherited ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polycystic-kidney-disease\\nAnswer: Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.  Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified.  Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.) \\n',\n",

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, or sometimes oats. It may also be found in some medicines.

(Also called: Sprue; Nontropical sprue; Gluten intolerance; Gluten-sensitive enteropathy)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000233.htm\\nAnswer: The exact cause of celiac disease is unknown. The lining of the intestines have small projections contains areas called villi. These structures help absorb nutrients. When people with celiac disease eat foods or use products that contain gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. As a result, the villi are unable absorb nutrients properly. Therefore, a person becomes malnourished, no matter how much food he or she eats.  The disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.

       " \"Question: What is (are) celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/celiac-disease\\nAnswer: Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/celiac-disease\\nAnswer: The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) myasthenia gravis ? (Also called: MG)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myasthenia-gravis\\nAnswer: Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life. This temporary occurrence of symptoms is called transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.) \\n',\n",

If you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten, your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins and supplements, lip balm, and even the glue on stamps and envelopes.    Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.    Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.\\n\\nReasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.\\n\\nHow it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.\\n\\nOff-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that \"wheat-free\" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy \"gluten-free\" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)\\n\\nThe Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.\\n\\nHealth Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.\\n\\nPossible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.\\n\\nEase of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.\\n\\nWhere to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.\\n\\nReasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.\\n\\nHow it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.\\n\\nOff-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that \"wheat-free\" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy \"gluten-free\" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)\\n\\nThe Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.\\n\\nHealth Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.\\n\\nPossible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.\\n\\nEase of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.\\n\\nWhere to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Low-salt diet (Also called: Low-sodium diet; Salt restriction)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000109.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Your body needs salt to work properly. Salt contains sodium. Sodium helps your body control many functions. Too much sodium in your diet can be bad for you. For most people, dietary sodium comes from salt that is in or added to their food.   If you have high blood pressure or heart failure, youwill likely be askedto limit how much salt you eat every day. Even people with normal blood pressure will have lower (and healthier) blood pressure if they lower how much salt they eat.   Dietary sodium is measured in milligrams (mg). Your doctor may tell you to eat no more than 2,300 mg a day when you have these conditions. For some people, 1,500 mg a day is an even better goal.\\n\\nLimiting Salt in Your Diet : Eating a variety of foods every day can help you limit salt. Try to eat a balanced diet.  Buy fresh vegetables and fruits whenever possible. They are naturally low in salt. Canned foods often contain salt to preserve the color of the food and keep it looking fresh. For this reason, it is better to buy fresh foods. Also buy:  - Fresh meats, chicken or turkey, and fish  - Fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits    Look for these words on labels:   - Low-sodium   - sodium-free  - No salt added  - Sodium-reduced  - Unsalted    Check all labels for how much salt foods contain per serving.  Ingredients are listed in order of the amount the food contains. Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list of ingredients. A product with less than 100 mg of salt per serving is good.  Stay away from foods that are always high in salt. Some common ones are:  - Processed foods, such as cured or smoked meats, bacon, hot dogs, sausage, bologna, ham, and salami  - Anchovies, olives, pickles, and sauerkraut  - Soy and Worcestershire sauces, tomato and other vegetable juices, and most cheeses  - Many bottled salad dressings and salad dressing mixes  - Most snack foods, such as chips, crackers, and others    When you cook, replace salt with other seasonings. Pepper, garlic, herbs, and lemon are good choices. Avoid packaged spice blends. They often contain salt.  Use garlic and onion powder, not garlic and onion salt. Do not eat foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG).  When you go out to eat, stick to steamed, grilled, baked, boiled, and broiled foods with no added salt, sauce, or cheese. If you think the restaurant might use MSG, ask them not to add it to your order.  Use oil and vinegar on salads. Add fresh or dried herbs. Eat fresh fruit or sorbet for dessert, when you have dessert. Take the salt shaker off your table. Replace it with a salt-free seasoning mix.  Ask your doctor or pharmacist what antacids and laxatives contain little or no salt, if you need these medicines. Some have a lot of salt in them.  Home water softeners add salt to water. If you have one, limit how much tap water you drink. Drink bottled water instead.  Ask your doctor if a salt substitute is safe for you. Many contain a lot of potassium. This may be harmful if you have certain medical conditions or if you are taking certain medicines. However, if extra potassium in your diet would not be harmful to you, a salt substitute is a good way to lower the amount of sodium in your diet.\\n\\nAlternate Names : Low-sodium diet; Salt restriction) \\n',\n",

(Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome\\nAnswer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is a condition that affects the normal development and function of the brain. The most common feature of this condition is recurrent seizures (epilepsy) in childhood. The seizures may occur during the day or at night during sleep. They are described as partial seizures because they affect only one area of the brain, a region called the frontal lobe. In many cases, the seizures are complex and resistant to treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Prolonged seizure episodes known as non-convulsive status epilepticus also appear to be characteristic of ring chromosome 20 syndrome. These episodes involve confusion and behavioral changes.  Most people with ring chromosome 20 syndrome also have some degree of intellectual disability and behavioral difficulties. Although these problems can appear either before or after the onset of epilepsy, they tend to worsen after seizures develop. Additional features of this condition can include slow growth and short stature, a small head (microcephaly), and subtle differences in facial features. Major birth defects are rarely seen with ring chromosome 20 syndrome.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome\\nAnswer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 20 syndrome have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells.  It is not well understood how the ring chromosome causes the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. In some affected individuals, genes near the ends of chromosome 20 are deleted when the ring chromosome forms. Researchers suspect that the loss of these genes may be responsible for epilepsy and other health problems. However, other affected individuals do not have gene deletions associated with the ring chromosome. In these people, the ring chromosome may change the activity of certain genes on chromosome 20, or it may be unable to copy (replicate) itself normally during cell division. Researchers are still working to determine the precise relationship between the ring chromosome 20 and the characteristic features of the syndrome.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: r(20) syndrome; ring 20 syndrome; ring chromosome 20; ring chromosome 20 epilepsy syndrome)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ring-chromosome-20-syndrome\\nAnswer: Ring chromosome 20 syndrome is almost never inherited. A ring chromosome typically occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. Often, the ring chromosome is present in only some of a person's cells. This situation is known as mosaicism.  Most affected individuals have no history of the disorder in their families.

It is different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine.    Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease.    Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity.

Your body needs some sodium to work properly. It helps with the function of nerves and muscles. It also helps to keep the right balance of fluids in your body. Your kidneys control how much sodium is in your body. If you have too much and your kidneys can't get rid it, sodium builds up in your blood. This can lead to high blood pressure. High blood pressure can lead to other health problems.    Most people in the U.S. get more sodium in their diets than they need. A key to healthy eating is choosing foods low in salt and sodium. Doctors recommend you eat less than 2.4 grams per day. That equals about 1 teaspoon of table salt a day. Reading food labels can help you see how much sodium is in prepared foods.

       " 'Question: What is Phosphate salts ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/735.html\\nAnswer: Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and minerals. Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and certain meats. Phosphates found in dairy products and meats seem to be more easily absorbed by the body than phosphates found in cereal grains. Cola drinks contain a lot of phosphate - so much, in fact, that they can cause too much phosphate in the blood.     People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.     Phosphate salts are taken by mouth for treating blood phosphate levels that are too low and blood calcium levels that are too high, and for preventing kidney stones. They are also taken for treating osteomalacia (often called rickets in children), a condition caused by a mineral imbalance in the body that leads to softening of the bones. Phosphate salts are also used for improving exercise performance, as an antacid for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and as a laxative for emptying the bowels before surgery.     Phosphate salts and calcium are applied to sensitive teeth to reduce pain.     Rectally, phosphate salts are used as a laxative to clean the bowels before surgery or intestinal tests.

The effectiveness ratings for PHOSPHATE SALTS are as follows: Effective for...  - Preparing the bowel for a medical procedure. Sodium phosphate tablets (OsmoPrep, Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Raleigh, NC) are FDA-approved for cleansing the colon before a colonoscopy. Over-the-counter sodium phosphate solutions and enemas may also be used for bowel cleansing before medical procedures.   - Low phosphate levels in the blood. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. Intravenous phosphate salts may also treat low phosphate levels in the blood when used under the supervision of a physician.  Likely effective for...  - Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for the treatment of constipation. These products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.   - Indigestion. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients used in antacids.   - High calcium levels in the blood. Taking phosphate salt (except calcium phosphate) by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But intravenous phosphate salts should not be used.   Possibly effective for...  - Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking potassium phosphate by mouth might help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in patients with high urine levels of calcium.  Possibly ineffective for...  - Athletic performance. Some early research suggests that taking sodium phosphate by mouth four times daily for 6 days might increase athletic performance in male cyclists. However, most evidence shows that taking phosphate salts by mouth does not improve exercise performance.  Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...  - Diabetes complication (diabetic ketoacidosis). Early research suggests that taking potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) does not improve a diabetes complication in which the body produces too many blood acids called ketones. People with this condition should only be given phosphates if they have low phosphate levels.   - Complications that occur upon eating in people who were previously starving (refeeding syndrome). Limited research shows that giving sodium and potassium phosphates intravenously (by IV) over 24 hours prevents refeeding syndrome when restarting nutrition in people who are severely malnourished or starved.    - Sensitive teeth.   - Other conditions.

       " 'Question: How should Amphetamine be used and what is the dosage ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a616004.html\\nAnswer: Amphetamine comes as an tablet (Evekeo) and as an extended-release (long-acting) suspension (Dyanavel XR) to take by mouth. The suspension is usually taken once daily in the morning with or without food. For treatment of ADHD or narcolepsy, the tablet is usually taken with or without food one to three times daily, 4 to 6 hours apart, with the first dose in the morning. For weight loss, the tablet is usually taken 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Amphetamine should not be taken in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amphetamine exactly as directed.  Shake the suspension well before each use to mix the medication evenly.  It is important to use an oral syringe (measuring device) to accurately measure and take your dose of the suspension. Ask your pharmacist for a device if it was not provided. Wash the oral syringe thoroughly after each use.  If you or your child are taking amphetamine for ADHD, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, every 4 to 7 days, depending on the medication. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking amphetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.  If you are taking amphetamine for narcolepsy, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amphetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week. Follow these directions carefully.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm\\nAnswer: Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis) \\n\",\n",

Know that breastfeeding takes practice. Give yourself 2 to 3 weeks to get the hang of it.   Learn how to position your baby to breastfeed. Know how to hold your baby in different positions so your nipples do not get sore and so you empty your breasts of milk.\\n\\nBreastfeeding Positions : You will be more comfortable nursing if you know how to position your baby on your breast. Find a position that works well for you and your baby. Learn about breastfeeding:  - Attend a breastfeeding class.  - Watch someone else breastfeed.  - Practice with an experienced nursing mother.  - Talk with a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant is an expert in breastfeeding. This person can teach you and your baby how to breastfeed. The consultant can help with positions and offer advice when your baby has trouble sucking.\\n\\nTypes of Breastfeeding Positions : CRADLE HOLD  This hold works best for full-term babies. Some new mothers have trouble guiding the baby's mouth to their breast in this hold. If you have had a cesarean birth (C-section), your baby may put too much pressure on your stomach in this hold.  Here's how to do the cradle hold:  - Sit in a comfortable chair with arm rests or a bed with pillows.  - Hold your baby on your lap, lying on the side so that the face, stomach, and knees are facing you.  - Tuck your baby's lower arm under your arm.  - If you are nursing on the right breast, hold your baby's head in the crook of your right arm. Use your arm and hand to support the neck, back, and bottom.  - Keep your baby's knees snug against your body.  - If your nipple hurts, see if your baby has slipped down and the knees are facing the ceiling instead of being tucked in next to your side. Adjust your baby's position if you need to.    FOOTBALL HOLD  Use the football hold if you had a C-section. This hold is good for babies that have trouble latching on because you can guide their head. Women with large breasts or flat nipples also like the football hold.  - Hold your baby like a football. Tuck the baby under the arm on the same side where you will nurse.  - Hold your baby at your side, under your arm.  - Cradle the back of your baby's head in your hand so the baby's nose is pointing at your nipple. The baby's feet and legs will be pointing back. Use your other hand to support your breast. Gently guide your baby to your nipple.    SIDE LYING POSITION  Use this position if you had a C-section or a hard delivery that makes it hard for you to sit up. You can use this position when you are lying in bed.  - Lie on your side.  - Lie your baby close to you with the baby's face at your breast. Pull your baby in snugly and place a pillow behind your baby's back to prevent backwards rolling.\\n\\nTake Care of Your Nipples : Your nipples naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. In order to keep your nipples healthy:  - Avoid soaps and harsh washing or drying of your breasts and nipples. This can cause dryness and cracking.  - Rub a little breast milk on your nipple after feeding to protect it. Keep your nipples dry to prevent cracking and infection.  - If you have cracked nipples, apply 100% pure lanolin after feedings.   - Try glycerin nipple pads that can be chilled and placed over your nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples.\\n\\nAlternate Names : Breastfeeding positions; Bonding with your baby) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Late syphilis; Tertiary syphilis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000861.htm\\nAnswer: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted, infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.  Syphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men. Young adults ages 15 to 25 are the highest-risk population. People have no natural resistance to syphilis.  Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis).  Syphilis has three stages:  - Primary syphilis  - Secondary syphilis  - Tertiary syphilis (the late phase of the illness)    Secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and congenital syphilis are not seen as often in the United States as they were in the past because of the availability of:  - Free, government-sponsored sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics  - Screening tests for syphilis  - Public education about STIs  - Prenatal screening) \\n',\n",

It infects the genital area, lips, mouth, or anus of both men and women. You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death.    Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if you catch it early. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading syphilis.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) \\n',\n",

To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.  Several hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection.  Symptoms and signs of this reaction include:  - Chills  - Fever  - General ill feeling (malaise)  - Headache  - Joint aches  - Muscle aches  - Nausea  - Rash    These symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.  Follow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone. Avoid sexual contact when the chancre is present. Use condoms until two follow-up tests have shown that the infection has been cured, to reduce the chance of transmitting the infection.

Glucagon is produced by cells in the pancreas. It helps control your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.   The provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:  - Diabetes  - Glucagonoma (rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis  - Growth hormone deficiency in children  - Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function)  - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\\n\\nNormal Results : The normal range is 50 to 100 pg/mL.

(Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000778.htm\\nAnswer: Prediabetes occurs when the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood is too high, but not high enough to be called diabetes.   If you have prediabetes, you are at a much higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. It also greatly increases your risk for heart disease.

(Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000778.htm\\nAnswer: Your body gets energy from the glucose in your blood. A hormone called insulin helps the cells in your body use glucose. If you have prediabetes, this process does not work as well. Glucose builds up in your bloodstream. If the levels get high enough, you can develop type 2 diabetes.  Having diabetes increases the risk for certain health problems. This is because high glucose levels in the blood can damage the blood vessels and nerves. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. If you have prediabetes, damage may already be occurring in your blood vessels.   Having prediabetes is a wake-up call to take action to improve your health.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Impaired fasting glucose - prediabetes; Impaired glucose tolerance - prediabetes)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000778.htm\\nAnswer: Your health care provider will talk with you about your condition and your risks from prediabetes. To help you prevent diabetes, your provider will likely suggest certain lifestyle changes:  Eat healthy foods: This includes whole grains, lean proteins, low-fat dairy, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Watch portion sizes, and avoid sweets and fried foods.   Lose weight: Just a small weight loss can make a big difference in your health. For example, your provider may suggest that you lose about 7% of your body weight. So, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose about 14 pounds. Your provider may suggest a diet or you can join a program to help you lose weight.  Get more exercise: Aim to get at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 days a week. This can include brisk walking, riding your bike, or swimming. You can also break up exercise into smaller sessions throughout the day.  Take medicines as directed: Depending on your other risk factors, your provider may prescribe medicines to lower cholesterol or blood pressure or to help prevent diabetes.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; G6PD Deficiency; G6PDD; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\\nAnswer: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis.  The most common medical problem associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs (such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria). Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).  Glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Blood Sugar (Also called: Blood glucose)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodsugar.html\\nAnswer: Summary : Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food you eat, and is your body's main source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all of your body's cells to use for energy.    Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar levels are too high. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. Even if you don't have diabetes, sometimes you may have problems with blood sugar that is too low or too high. Keeping a regular schedule of eating, activity, and taking any medicines you need can help.    If you do have diabetes, it is very important to keep your blood sugar numbers in your target range. You may need to check your blood sugar several times each day. Your health care provider will also do a blood test called an A1C. It checks your average blood sugar level over the past three months. If your blood sugar is too high, you may need to take medicines and/or follow a special diet.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Communicating with patients\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000456.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care. It also aligns with the growing movement toward patient- and family-centered care.  To be effective, patient education needs to be more than instructions and information. Teachers and health care providers need to be able to assess patient needs and communicate clearly.  The success of patient education depends largely on how well you assess your patient's:  - Needs  - Concerns  - Readiness to learn  - Preferences  - Support  - Barriers and limitations (such as physical and mental capacity, and low health literacy)    Often, the first step is to find out what the patient already knows. Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:  - Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe the patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time.  - Get to know your patient. Introduce yourself and explain your role in your patient's care. Review their medical record and ask basic get-to-know-you questions.  - Establish a rapport. Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to the person's concerns.  - Gain trust. Show respect and treat each person with compassion and without judgment.  - Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.  - Learn the patient's perspective. Talk to the patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.  - Ask the right questions. Ask if the patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require the patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. The patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand the patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.  - Learn about the patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what the patient may have learned from other health care providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that the patient they understands. Also, find out what skills the patient may still need to develop.  - Involve others. Ask if the patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved. Learn about the support available to your patient.  - Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and the patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.  - Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment. It is worth it, because your patient education efforts will be more effective.) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Deciding to have knee or hip replacement\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000368.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : There are many ways to help decide to have knee or hip replacement surgery or not. These may include reading about the operation and talking to others with knee or hip problems.  A key step is talking to your health care provider about your quality of life and goals for surgery.  Surgery may or may not be the right choice for you. Only careful thought can help you make a decision.\\n\\nWho Benefits From Knee or hip Replacement Surgery? : The most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when:  - Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities.  - You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker.  - Your pain has not improved with other treatment.  - You understand the surgery and recovery involved.    Some people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them. They will wait until the problems are more severe. Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy.  Knee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first.\\n\\nIs There any Harm in Waiting? : For the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done to provide relief for your pain, not for any other medical reason.  In most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future. In some cases, the provider may strongly recommend surgery if deformity or extreme wear and tear on the joint affects other parts of your body.  Also, if pain is preventing you from moving around well, the muscles around your joints may become weaker and your bones may become thinner. This may affect your recovery time if you have surgery at a later date.\\n\\nWhy you may not be Able to Have Replacement Surgery : Your provider may recommend against knee or hip replacement surgery if you have any of the following:  - Extreme obesity (weighing over 300 pounds)  - Weak quadriceps, the muscles in the front of your thighs, that can make it very hard for you to walk and use your knee  - Unhealthy skin around the joint  - Previous infection of your knee or hip  - Previous surgery or injuries that do not allow for a successful joint replacement  - Heart or lung problems, which make major surgery more risky  - Other health conditions that may not allow you to recover well from joint replacement surgery) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Total hip replacement; Hip hemiarthroplasty)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002975.htm\\nAnswer: Your hip joint is made up of two major parts. One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:  -  The hip socket (a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum)   -  The upper end of the thighbone (called the femoral head)    The new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:  - A socket, which is usually made of strong metal.  - A liner, which fits inside the socket. It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.  - A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone.  - A metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to make the joint more stable.    You will not feel any pain during surgery. You will have one of two types of anesthesia:  - General anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.   -  Regional (spinal or epidural anesthesia). Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.    After you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a surgical cut to open up your hip joint. Often this cut is over the buttocks. Then your surgeon will:  - Cut and remove the head of your thigh bone  - Clean out your hip socket and remove the rest of the cartilage and damaged or arthritic bone  - Put the new hip socket in place, then insert the metal stem into your thigh bone  - Place the correct-sized ball for the new joint  - Secure all of the new parts in place, sometimes with a special cement  - Repair the muscles and tendons around the new joint  - Close the surgical wound    This surgery takes about 1 - 3 hours.) \\n',\n",

Most or all of your pain and stiffness should go away.  Some people may have problems with infection, loosening, or even dislocation of the new hip joint.  Over time the artificial hip joint will loosen. This can happen after as long as 15 - 20 years. You may need a second replacement.  Younger, more active people may wear out parts of their new hip.

This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.\\n\\nWhat to Expect at Home : By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your health care provider about when to stop using crutches.  You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help.  You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions.   You will need to have someone with you at home 24 hours a day for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities.  Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing.\\n\\nHome Setup : Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You will not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm.  Keep tripping hazards out of your home.  - Learn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting.  - Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower.  - DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance.    Put things where they are easy to reach.   Place a chair with a firm back in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and other rooms you will use. This way, you can sit when you do your daily tasks.  Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are:  - Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor.  - Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day.\\n\\nActivity : You will need to be careful to not dislocate your new hip when you are walking, sitting, lying down, dressing, taking a bath or shower, and doing other activities.   Keep moving and walking once you get home. DO NOT put your full weight on your side with the new hip until your doctor tells you it is okay. Start out with short periods of activity, and then gradually increase them. Your doctor or physical therapist will give you exercises to do at home.  Use your crutches or walker for as long as you need them. Check with your provider before you stop using them.  After a few days you may be able to do simple household chores. DO NOT try to do heavier chores, such as vacuuming or laundry. Remember, you will get tired quickly at first.  Wear a small fanny pack or backpack, or attach a basket or strong bag to your walker, so that you can keep small household items, like a phone and notepad, with you.\\n\\nWound Care : Keep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing according to when your provider told you to change it. Be sure to change it if it gets dirty or wet. Follow these steps when you change your dressing:  - Wash your hands well with soap and water.  - Remove the dressing carefully. DO NOT pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it.  - Soak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. DO NOT wipe back and forth over the same area.  - Dry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just 1 direction.  - Check your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor.  - Apply a new dressing the way you were shown.    Sutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. DO NOT shower until 3 to 4 days after your surgery, or when your provider told you to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision but DO NOT scrub it or let the water beat down on it. DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool.  You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too.\\n\\nSelf-care : Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should.  In the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity can help control pain.  You may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk of blood clots. Take all your medicines the way your provider told you to.  Your provider will tell you when it is okay to start sexual activity again.  People who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. You should carry a medical identification card in your wallet that says you have a prosthesis. You will need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures. Check with your provider and make sure you tell your dentist that you had a hip replacement and need antibiotics before any dental work.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Doctor : Call your health care provider if you have:  - A sudden increase in pain  - Chest pain or shortness of breath  - Frequent urination or burning when you urinate  - Redness or increasing pain around your incision  - Drainage from your incision  - Blood in your stools, or your stools turn dark  - Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg)  - Pain in your calf  - Fever greater than 101F (38.3C)  - Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines  - Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools if you are taking blood thinners    Also call if you:  - Cannot move your hip as much as you could before  - Fall or hurt your leg on the side that had surgery  - Have increased pain in your hip\\n\\nAlternate Names : Hip arthroplasty - discharge; Total hip replacement - discharge; Hip hemiarthroplasty - discharge; Osteoarthritis - hip) \\n',\n",

It uses a smaller surgical cut. Also, fewer muscles around the hip are cut or detached.\\n\\nDescription : To perform this surgery:  - A cut will be made in one of three places -- on the back of the hip (over the buttock), on the front of the hip (near the groin), or on the side of the hip.  - In most cases, the cut will be 3to 6 inches long. In a regular hip replacement surgery, the cut is 10to 12 inches long.  - The surgeon will use special instruments to work through the small cut.  - Surgery involves cutting and removing bone. The surgeon will remove some muscles and other tissues. Less tissue is removed than in regular surgery. Most of the time, muscles are not cut or detached.   This procedure uses the same type of hip replacement implants as regular surgery.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : As in regular surgery, this procedure is done to replace or repair a diseased or damaged hip joint. This technique works better for people who are younger and thinner. Minimally invasive techniques may allow for a quicker recovery and less pain.  You may not qualify for this procedure if   - Your arthritis is quite severe.   - You have medical problems that do not allow you to have this surgery.   Talk with your surgeon about the benefits and risks.

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Pulling a patient up in bed (Also called: Moving a patient in bed)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000429.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : A patient's body may slowly slide when the person is in bed for a long time. The person may ask to be moved up higher for comfort or may need to be moved up so a health care provider can do an exam.\\n\\nAvoiding injury : You must move or pull someone up in bed the right way to avoid injuring the patient's shoulders and skin. Using the right method will also help protect your back.  It takes at least two people to safely move a patient up in bed.  Friction from rubbing can scrape or tear the person's skin. Common areas at risk for friction are the shoulders, back, buttocks, elbows, and heels.   Never move patients up by grabbing them under their arms and pulling. This can injure their shoulders.\\n\\nPreparing to move the patient : A slide sheet is the best way to prevent friction. If you do not have one, you can make a draw sheet out of a bed sheet folded in half. Follow these steps to prepare the patient:  - Tell the patient what you are doing.  - Make the bed flat.  - Roll the patient to one side, then place a half rolled-up slide sheet or draw sheet against the person's back.  - Roll the patient onto the sheet and spread the sheet out flat under the person.  - Make sure the head, shoulders, and hips are on the sheet.\\n\\nPulling up : The goal is to pull, not lift, the patient toward the head of the bed. The two people moving the patient should stand on opposite sides of the bed. To pull the person up both people should:   - Grab the slide sheet or draw sheet on the side of the bed closest to you.  - Put one foot forward as you prepare to move the patient.  - On the count of three, move the patient by pulling the sheet toward the head of the bed. You may need to do this more than once to get the person in the right position.    If using a slide sheet, remove it when you're done.  If the patient can help you, ask the patient to:  - Bring the chin up to the chest and bend the knees. The patient's heels should remain on the bed.  - Have the patient push with the heels while you pull up.) \\n\",\n",

This helps the skin stay healthy and prevents bedsores.  Turning a patient is a good time to check the skin for redness and sores.\\n\\nGetting a patient ready : - Explain to the patient what you are planning to do so the person knows what to expect. Encourage the person to help you if possible.  - Stand on the side of the bed the patient will be turning towards and lower the bed rail.  - Ask the patient to look towards you. This will be the direction in which the person is turning.  - Move the patient to the center of the bed so the person is not at risk of rolling out of the bed. Make sure the rail is up on the side you are turning the person toward.  - The patient's bottom arm should be stretched towards you. Place the person's top arm across the chest.  - Cross the patient's upper ankle over the bottom ankle.    If you are turning the patient onto the stomach, make sure the person's bottom hand is above the head first.\\n\\nTurning a patient : - If you can, raise the bed to a level that reduces back strain for you. Make the bed flat.  - Get as close to the person as you can.  - Place one of your hands on the patient's shoulder and your other hand on the hip.  - Standing with one foot ahead of the other, shift your weight to your front foot as you gently pull the patient's shoulder toward you. Then shift your weight to your back foot as you gently pull the person's hip toward you.    You may need to repeat steps 3 and 4 until the patient is in the right position.\\n\\nWhen the patient is in the right position : - Make sure the patient's ankles, knees, and elbows are not resting on top of each other.  - Make sure the head and neck are in line with the spine, not stretched forward, back, or to the side.  - Return the bed to a comfortable position with the side rails up. Check with the patient to make sure the patient is comfortable. Use pillows as needed.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Hip Replacement (Also called: Hip arthroplasty; Hip prosthesis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hipreplacement.html\\nAnswer: Summary : Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.    During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.    A hip replacement can       - Relieve pain    - Help your hip joint work better    - Improve walking and other movements       The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Conscious sedation for surgical procedures (Also called: Anesthesia - conscious)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007409.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Conscious sedation is a combination of medicines to help you relax (a sedative) and to block pain (an anesthetic) during a medical or dental procedure. You will probably stay awake but may not be able to speak.  Conscious sedation lets you recover quickly and return to your everyday activities soon after your procedure.\\n\\nDescription : A nurse, doctor, or dentist, will give you conscious sedation in the hospital or outpatient clinic. Most of the time, it will not be an anesthesiologist. The medicine will wear off quickly, so it is used for short, uncomplicated procedures.  You may receive the medicine through an intravenous line (IV, in a vein) or a shot into a muscle. You will begin to feel drowsy and relaxed very quickly. If your doctor gives you the medicine to swallow, you will feel the effects after about 30 to 60 minutes.  Your breathing will slow down, and your blood pressure may drop a little. Your health care provider will monitor you every during your procedure to make sure you are okay. This person will stay with you at all times during the procedure.  You should not need help with your breathing. But you may receive extra oxygen through a mask or IV fluids through a catheter (tube) into a vein.  You may fall asleep, but you will wake up easily to respond to people in the room. You may be able to respond to verbal cues. After conscious sedation, you may feel drowsy and not remember much about your procedure.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : Conscious sedation is safe and effective for people who need minor surgery or a procedure to diagnose a condition.  Some of the tests and procedures conscious sedation may be used for are:  - Breast biopsy  - Dental prosthetic or reconstructive surgery  - Minor bone fracture repair  - Minor foot surgery  - Minor skin surgery  - Plastic or reconstructive surgery  - Procedures to diagnose and treat some stomach (upper endoscopy), colon (colonoscopy), lung (bronchoscopy), and bladder (cystoscopy) conditions\\n\\nRisks : Conscious sedation is usually safe. However, if you are given too much of the medicine, problems with your breathing may occur. A health care provider will be watching you during the whole procedure.  Providers always have special equipment to help you with your breathing, if needed. Only certain qualified health professionals can provide conscious sedation.\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Tell the health care provider:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription    During the days before your procedure:  - Tell your provider about allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - You may have blood or urine tests and a physical exam.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic for the procedure.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your provider for help quitting.    On the day of your procedure:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - DO NOT drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital or clinic on time.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : After conscious sedation, you will feel sleepy and may have a headache or feel sick to your stomach. During recovery, your finger will be clipped to a special device (pulse oximeter) to check the oxygen levels in your blood. Your blood pressure will be checked with an arm cuff about every 15 minutes.  You should be able to go home 1 to 2 hours after your procedure.  When you are home:  - Eat a healthy meal to restore your energy.  - You should be able to return to your everyday activities the next day.  - Avoid driving, operating machinery, drinking alcohol, and making legal decisions for at least 24 hours.  - Check with your doctor before taking any medicines or herbal supplements.  - If you had surgery, follow your doctor's instructions for recovery and wound care.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : Conscious sedation is generally safe, and is an option for procedures or diagnostic tests.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about General anesthesia\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007410.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : General anesthesia is treatment with certain medicines that puts you into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery. After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you.\\n\\nDescription : Most times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified and registered nurse anesthetist will take care of you.  The medicine is given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs.  You will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored. The health care provider taking care of you can change how deeply asleep you are during the surgery.  You will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of this medicine.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : General anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would:  - Be too painful  - Take a long time  - Affect your ability to breathe  - Make you uncomfortable  - Cause too much anxiety    You may also be able to have conscious sedation for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to handle any pain or anxiety they may feel.\\n\\nRisks : General anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people. You may have a higher risk of problems with general anesthesia if you:  - Abuse alcohol or medicines  - Have allergies or a family history of being allergic to medicines  - Have heart, lung, or kidney problems  - Smoke    Ask your doctor about these complications:  - Death (rare)  - Harm to your vocal cords  - Heart attack  - Lung infection  - Mental confusion (temporary)  - Stroke  - Trauma to the teeth or tongue  - Waking during anesthesia (rare)\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Tell your health care provider:  - If you could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription    During the days before the surgery:  - An anesthesiologist will take a complete medical history to determine the type and amount of the anesthesia you need. This includes asking you about any allergies, health conditions, medicines, and history of anesthesia.  - Several days to a week before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin).  - Ask your provider which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - Always try to stop smoking. Your doctor can help.    On the day of your surgery:  - You will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery. This is to prevent you from vomiting while you are under the effect of the anesthesia. Vomiting can cause food in the stomach to be inhaled into the lungs. This can lead to breathing problems.  - Take the drugs that your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital on time.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : You will wake up tired and groggy in the recovery or operating room. You may also feel sick to your stomach, and have a dry mouth, sore throat, or feel cold or restless until the effect of the anesthesia wears off. Your nurse will monitor these side effects, which will wear off, but it may take a few hours. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be treated with other medicines.  Follow your surgeon's instructions while you recover and care for your surgical wound.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : General anesthesia is generally safe because of modern equipment, medicines, and safety standards. Most people recover completely and do not have any complications.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Spinal and epidural anesthesia (Also called: Intraspinal anesthesia; Subarachnoid anesthesia; Epidural; Peridural anesthesia)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007413.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine.\\n\\nDescription : The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist.  First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic.  You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly.  For an epidural:  - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space.  - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth.  - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure.   For a spinal:  - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed.  - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures.   Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your bloodare checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Patients usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk.  Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures.  Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs.  Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when:  - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine.  - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet.  - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure.  - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia.\\n\\nRisks : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications:  - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used  - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma)  - Difficulty urinating  - Drop in blood pressure  - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess)  - Nerve damage  - Seizures (this is rare)  - Severe headache\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription   During the days before the procedure:  - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your doctor or nurse for help quitting.   On the day of the procedure:  - You may be told not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.  - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you what time to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.  After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Hereditary urea cycle abnormality (Also called: Abnormality of the urea cycle - hereditary; Urea cycle - hereditary abnormality)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000372.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Hereditary urea cycle abnormality is an inherited condition that can cause problems with the removal of waste from the body in the urine.\\n\\nCauses : The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.  The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.  Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.  These diseases include:  - Argininosuccinic aciduria  - Arginase deficiency  - Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency  - Citrullinemia  - N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS)  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)   As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders.  Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.  To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder.\\n\\nSymptoms : Typically, the baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This usually occurs within the first week after birth.  Symptoms include:  - Confusion  - Decreased food intake  - Dislike offoods that contain protein  - Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up  - Nausea, vomiting\\n\\nExams and Tests : The doctor will often diagnose these disorders when the child is still an infant.  Signs may include:  - Abnormal amino acids in blood and urine  - Abnormal level of orotic acid in blood or urine  - High blood ammonia level  - Normal level of acid in blood   Tests may include:  - Genetic tests  - Liver biopsy  - MRI or CT scan\\n\\nTreatment : Limiting protein in the diet can help treat these disorders by reducing the amount of nitrogen wastes the body produces. Special low-protein infant and toddler formulas are available.  It is important that a health care provider guide protein intake. The health care provider can balance the amount of protein so that the baby has enough to grow, but not enough to cause symptoms.  It is extremely important for people with these disorders to avoid fasting.  People with urea cycle abnormalities must also be very careful under times of stress, such as when they have infections. Stress, such as a fever, can cause the body to break down its own proteins. These extra proteins can make it difficult for the abnormal urea cycle to remove the byproducts.  Develop a plan with your doctor for when you are sick to avoid all protein, drink high carbohydrate drinks, and get enough fluids.  Most patients with urea cycle disorders will need to stay in the hospital at some point. During such times, they may be treated with medicines that help the body remove nitrogen-containing wastes. Dialysis may help rid the body of excess ammonia during extreme illness.\\n\\nSupport Groups : National Urea Cycle Disorders Forum -- www.nucdf.org\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : How well patients do depends on:  - Which urea cycle abnormality they have  - How severe it is  - How early it is discovered  - How closely they follow a protein-restricted diet   Babies diagnosed in the first week of life and put on a protein-restricted diet right away do well.  Sticking to the diet can lead to normal adult intelligence. Repeatedly not following the diet or having stress-induced symptoms can lead to brain swelling and brain damage.  Major stresses, such as surgery or accidents, can be complicated for these patients. Extreme care is needed to avoid problems during such periods.\\n\\nPossible Complications : - Coma  - Confusion and eventually disorientation  - Death  - Increases in blood ammonia level  - Swelling of the brain\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : If your child has a test that shows increased ammonia in the blood, have the child examined by a genetic or metabolic specialist. If there is a family history of urea cycle disorder, seek genetic counseling before trying to get pregnant.  A dietician is important to help plan and update a protein-restricted diet as the child grows.\\n\\nPrevention : As with most inherited diseases, there is no way to prevent these disorders. Prenatal testing is available. Genetic testing before an embryo is implanted may be available for those using in vitro fertilization.  Teamwork between parents, the affected child, and doctors can help prevent severe illness.) \\n\",\n",

Most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. If the vein swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism.    Sitting still for a long time can make you more likely to get a DVT. Some medicines and disorders that increase your risk for blood clots can also lead to DVTs. Common symptoms are        -  Warmth and tenderness over the vein     -  Pain or swelling in the part of the body affected     -  Skin redness        Treatment includes medicines to ease pain and inflammation, break up clots and keep new clots from forming. Keeping the affected area raised and applying moist heat can also help. If you are taking a long car or plane trip, take a break, walk or stretch your legs and drink plenty of liquids.) \\n',\n",

But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.\\n\\nCauses : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething\\n\\nHome Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying\\n\\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms.

If you suspect someone has overdosed, or if you suspect someone is experiencing withdrawal, give first aid and seek medical assistance.  Try to find out what drug the person has taken. If possible, collect all drug containers and any remaining drug samples or the person's vomit and take them to the hospital.  The National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) can be called from anywhere in the United States. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  See: Poison control center - emergency number  The health care provider will perform a history and physical examination. Tests and procedures will be done as necessary.  These may include:  - Activated charcoal and laxatives to help remove swallowed drugs from the body (sometimes given through a tube placed through the nose into the stomach)  - Airway and breathing support, including a face mask, tube through the mouth into the trachea, and breathing machine (ventilator)  - Blood and urine tests  - CT scan of the head, neck, and other areas  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)  - Intravenous fluids (fluids through a vein)  - Medications to reverse the effects of the drugs  - Psychiatric and social work evaluation and assistance   In serious cases, the person may need to be admitted to the hospital for further observation and treatment.  The outcome will depend on the type and amount of drugs used, the route of entry into the body, and any medical conditions that may be present. Both long- and short-term use of opioids may result in acute or permanent disability, including heart, lung, liver, kidney, and brain damage. Repeated infections may overwhelm the immune system.

(Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance\\nAnswer: Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine.  Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula. This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants are not given a lactose-free infant formula, they may develop severe dehydration and weight loss.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy (lactase nonpersistence). If individuals with lactose intolerance consume lactose-containing dairy products, they may experience abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and diarrhea beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours later.  Most people with lactase nonpersistence retain some lactase activity and can include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing symptoms. Often, affected individuals have difficulty digesting fresh milk but can eat certain dairy products such as cheese or yogurt without discomfort. These foods are made using fermentation processes that break down much of the lactose in milk.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: alactasia; dairy product intolerance; hypolactasia; lactose malabsorption; milk sugar intolerance)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance\\nAnswer: Lactose intolerance in infants (congenital lactase deficiency) is caused by mutations in the LCT gene. The LCT gene provides instructions for making the lactase enzyme. Mutations that cause congenital lactase deficiency are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula.  Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity (expression) of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6. Some individuals have inherited changes in this element that lead to sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life. People without these changes have a reduced ability to digest lactose as they get older, resulting in the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance.) \\n',\n",

The last 2 types also occur in animals.  Hookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off.  There is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who have hookworm.  The larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one half inch long.  After traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which results in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease-like-syndrome\\nAnswer: As its name suggests, a Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndrome is a condition that resembles Huntington disease. Researchers have described four HDL syndromes, designated Huntington disease-like 1 (HDL1) through Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4). These progressive brain disorders are characterized by uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. HDL syndromes occur in people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease who do not have a mutation in HD, the gene typically associated with that disorder.  HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 usually appear in early to mid-adulthood, although they can begin earlier in life. The first signs and symptoms of these conditions often include irritability, emotional problems, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many affected people develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these abnormal movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may develop problems with walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with these disorders also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with an HDL syndrome can live for a few years to more than a decade after signs and symptoms begin.  HDL3 begins much earlier in life than most of the other HDL syndromes (usually around age 3 or 4). Affected children experience a decline in thinking ability, difficulties with movement and speech, and seizures. Because HDL3 has a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms and a different pattern of inheritance, researchers are unsure whether it belongs in the same category as the other HDL syndromes.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Huntington disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease-like syndromes; Huntington's disease phenocopies; Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease-like-syndrome\\nAnswer: In about one percent of people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease, no mutation in the HD gene has been identified. Mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes have been found to cause the signs and symptoms in some of these individuals. HDL1 is caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, while HDL2 results from mutations in JPH3. Mutations in the TBP gene are responsible for HDL4 (also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 17). The genetic cause of HDL3 is unknown.  The PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes provide instructions for making proteins that are important for normal brain function. The features of HDL syndromes result from a particular type of mutation in any one of these genes. This mutation increases the length of a repeated segment of DNA within the gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal PRNP, JPH3, or TBP protein. The abnormal protein can build up in nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL syndromes.  Other medical conditions and gene mutations may also cause signs and symptoms resembling Huntington disease. In some affected people, the cause of the disorder is never identified.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: GPA; Wegener granulomatosis; Wegener's granulomatosis)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis\\nAnswer: The genetic basis of GPA is not well understood. Having a particular version of the HLA-DPB1 gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing this condition, although several other genes, some of which have not been identified, may be involved. It is likely that a combination of genetic and environmental factors lead to GPA.  GPA is an autoimmune disorder. Such disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Approximately 90 percent of people with GPA have an abnormal immune protein called an anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) in their blood. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but ANCAs attack normal human proteins. Most people with GPA have an ANCA that attacks the human protein proteinase 3 (PR3). A few affected individuals have an ANCA that attacks a protein called myeloperoxidase (MPO). When these antibodies attach to the protein they recognize, they trigger inflammation, which contributes to the signs and symptoms of GPA.  The HLA-DPB1 gene belongs to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. A particular variant of the HLA-DPB1 gene called HLA-DPB1*0401 has been found more frequently in people with GPA, especially those with ANCAs, than in people without the condition.  Because the HLA-DPB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation in the respiratory tract and kidneys characteristic of GPA. However, it is unclear what specific role the HLA-DPB1*0401 gene variant plays in development of this condition.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Glomerulonephritis - post-streptococcal; Post-infectious glomerulonephritis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000503.htm\\nAnswer: Post-streptococcal GN is a form of glomerulonephritis. It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat.  The strep bacterial infection causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the urine.  Post-streptococcal GN is uncommon today because infections that can lead to the disorder are commonly treated with antibiotics. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.  It may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10.

(Also called: GPA; Wegener granulomatosis; Wegener's granulomatosis)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis\\nAnswer: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a condition that causes inflammation that primarily affects the respiratory tract (including the lungs and airways) and the kidneys. This disorder is also commonly known as Wegener granulomatosis. A characteristic feature of GPA is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), particularly the small- and medium-sized blood vessels in the lungs, nose, sinuses, windpipe, and kidneys, although vessels in any organ can be involved. Polyangiitis refers to the inflammation of multiple types of vessels, such as small arteries and veins. Vasculitis causes scarring and tissue death in the vessels and impedes blood flow to tissues and organs.  Another characteristic feature of GPA is the formation of granulomas, which are small areas of inflammation composed of immune cells that aid in the inflammatory reaction. The granulomas usually occur in the lungs or airways of people with this condition, although they can occur in the eyes or other organs. As granulomas grow, they can invade surrounding areas, causing tissue damage.  The signs and symptoms of GPA vary based on the tissues and organs affected by vasculitis. Many people with this condition experience a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), fever, weight loss, or other general symptoms of the body's immune reaction. In most people with GPA, inflammation begins in the vessels of the respiratory tract, leading to nasal congestion, frequent nosebleeds, shortness of breath, or coughing. Severe inflammation in the nose can lead to a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils (nasal septum perforation) or a collapse of the septum, causing a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose).  The kidneys are commonly affected in people with GPA. Tissue damage caused by vasculitis in the kidneys can lead to decreased kidney function, which may cause increased blood pressure or blood in the urine, and life-threatening kidney failure. Inflammation can also occur in other regions of the body, including the eyes, middle and inner ear structures, skin, joints, nerves, heart, and brain. Depending on which systems are involved, additional symptoms can include skin rashes, inner ear pain, swollen and painful joints, and numbness or tingling in the limbs.  GPA is most common in middle-aged adults, although it can occur at any age. If untreated, the condition is usually fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Even after treatment, vasculitis can return.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Noninsulin-dependent diabetes; Diabetes - type 2; Adult-onset diabetes)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000313.htm\\nAnswer: Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.   When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.  When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.  Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.  Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.) \\n',\n",

This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.  - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.  - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.  - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage.

       " \"Question: What is (are) Type 2 diabetes - self-care ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000328.htm\\nAnswer: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic (lifelong) disease. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body has trouble using the insulin it normally makes. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas to control blood sugar. When your body's insulin is not used correctly, the sugar from food stays in the blood and the level can get too high. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes may not have enough insulin.  Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight when they are diagnosed. Type 2 diabetes usually happens slowly.

       " 'Question: What is (are) Diabetes Type 2 ? (Also called: Type 2 Diabetes)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetestype2.html\\nAnswer: Diabetes means your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin, too much glucose stays in your blood. Over time, high blood glucose can lead to serious problems with your heart, eyes, kidneys, nerves, and gums and teeth.    You have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if you are older, obese, have a family history of diabetes, or do not exercise. Having prediabetes also increases your risk. Prediabetes means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes.    The symptoms of type 2 diabetes appear slowly. Some people do not notice symptoms at all. The symptoms can include       - Being very thirsty    - Urinating often    - Feeling very hungry or tired    - Losing weight without trying    - Having sores that heal slowly    - Having blurry eyesight       Blood tests can show if you have diabetes. One type of test, the A1C, can also check on how you are managing your diabetes. Many people can manage their diabetes through healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing.

Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.  To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:  - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.  - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.     People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the bloodinto muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and because their liver makestoo much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:  - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin  - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally  - Both of the above    There are 2 major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:   - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.  - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease.Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.  - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.    Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.  If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.) \\n\",\n",

Drops will be placed into your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. The eye doctor will use special lenses to view your retina, blood vessels, and optic nerve.  The eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen.  You may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lineslook wavy, it may be a sign of AMD.  Other tests that may be done include:  -  Using special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina (fluorescein angiogram)   - Taking a photo of the inner lining of the eye (fundus photography)  - Using light waves to view the retina (optical coherence tomography)  - A test that measures the pigment in the macula) \\n',\n",

(Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration\\nAnswer: Age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss in older people in developed countries. The vision loss usually becomes noticeable in a person's sixties or seventies and tends to worsen over time.  Age-related macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. The vision loss in this condition results from a gradual deterioration of light-sensing cells in the tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color (the retina). Specifically, age-related macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina, called the macula, which is responsible for central vision. Side (peripheral) vision and night vision are generally not affected.  Researchers have described two major types of age-related macular degeneration, known as the dry form and the wet form. The dry form is much more common, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases of age-related macular degeneration. It is characterized by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen beneath the retina and slowly progressive vision loss. The condition typically affects vision in both eyes, although vision loss often occurs in one eye before the other.  The wet form of age-related macular degeneration is associated with severe vision loss that can worsen rapidly. This form of the condition is characterized by the growth of abnormal, fragile blood vessels underneath the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid, which damages the macula and makes central vision appear blurry and distorted.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: age-related maculopathy; AMD; ARMD; macular degeneration, age-related)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration\\nAnswer: Age-related macular degeneration results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors have been identified, but some remain unknown.  Researchers have considered changes in many genes as possible risk factors for age-related macular degeneration. The best-studied of these genes are involved in a part of the body\\'s immune response known as the complement system. This system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Genetic changes in and around several complement system genes, including the CFH gene, contribute to a person\\'s risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. It is unclear how these genetic changes are related to the retinal damage and vision loss characteristic of this condition.  Changes on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 in a region known as 10q26 are also associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. The 10q26 region contains two genes of interest, ARMS2 and HTRA1. Changes in both genes have been studied as possible risk factors for the disease. However, because the two genes are so close together, it is difficult to tell which gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk, or whether increased risk results from variations in both genes.  Other genes that are associated with age-related macular degeneration include genes involved in transporting and processing high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as \"good\" cholesterol) and genes that have been associated with other forms of macular disease.  Researchers have also examined nongenetic factors that contribute to the risk of age-related macular degeneration. Age appears to be the most important risk factor; the chance of developing the condition increases significantly as a person gets older. Smoking is another established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. Other factors that may increase the risk of this condition include high blood pressure, heart disease, a high-fat diet or one that is low in certain nutrients (such as antioxidants and zinc), obesity, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.

It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.

Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been shown to cause harm to a baby as it develops in the womb. Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects.\\n\\nInformation : When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby\\'s blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby\\'s body than in an adult. That means the baby\\'s blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother\\'s. This can harm the baby and can sometimes lead to lifelong damage.  DANGERS OF ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY  Drinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome. Symptoms can include:  - Behavior and attention problems  - Heart defects  - Changes in the shape of the face  - Poor growth before and after birth  - Poor muscle tone and problems with movement and balance  - Problems with thinking and speech  - Learning problems    These medical problems are lifelong and can range from mild to severe.   Complications seen in the infant may include:  - Cerebral palsy  - Premature delivery  - Miscarriage or stillbirth    HOW MUCH ALCOHOL IS SAFE?  There is no known \"safe\" amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol anytime during pregnancy can be harmful.  Alcohol includes beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor.  One drink is defined as:  - 12 oz of beer  - 5 oz of wine  - 1.5 oz of liquor    How much you drink is just as important as how often you drink.  - Even if you don\\'t drink often, drinking a large amount at one time can harm the baby.  - Binge drinking (5 or more drinks on one sitting) greatly increases a baby\\'s risk of alcohol-related damage.  - Drinking moderate amounts of alcohol when pregnant may lead to miscarriage.  - Heavy drinkers (those who drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages a day) are at greater risk of giving birth to a child with fetal alcohol syndrome.  - The more you drink, the more you raise your baby\\'s risk for harm.    DO NOT DRINK DURING PREGNANCY  Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. The only way to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is to not drink alcohol during pregnancy.  If you did not know you were pregnant and drank alcohol, stop drinking as soon as you find out. The sooner you stop drinking alcohol, the healthier your baby will be.  Choose non-alcoholic versions of beverages you like.   If you cannot control your drinking, avoid being around other people who are using alcohol.  Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program. They should also be followed closely by a health care provider.

Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of a digestive fluid called bile from liver cells. As a result, bile builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Because the problems with bile release occur within the liver (intrahepatic), the condition is described as intrahepatic cholestasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually becomes apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery of the baby, and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear. However, they can return during later pregnancies.  This condition causes severe itchiness (pruritus) in the expectant mother. The itchiness usually begins on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads to other parts of the body. Occasionally, affected women have yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Some studies have shown that women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy are more likely to develop gallstones sometime in their life than women who do not have the condition.  Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy can cause problems for the unborn baby. This condition is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and stillbirth.

Rarely, a hydatidiform mole develops into a choriocarcinoma. This is a fast-growing cancer. It is usually treated with chemotherapy, and can be life-threatening.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Hydatid mole; Molar pregnancy)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000909.htm\\nAnswer: Hydatidiform mole, or molar pregnancy, results from too much production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta. The placenta feeds the fetus during pregnancy. With a molar pregnancy, the tissues develop into an abnormal growth, called a mass.  There are 2 types of these masses:  - Partial molar pregnancy. There is an abnormal placenta and some fetal development.  - Complete molar pregnancy. There is an abnormal placenta and no fetus.    Both forms are due to problems during fertilization. The exact cause of fertilization problems is unknown.   There are no known ways to prevent these masses from forming.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Ankle arthroscopy (Also called: Ankle surgery; Arthroscopy - ankle; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopy; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopic)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007584.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Ankle arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your ankle. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows the doctor to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.\\n\\nDescription : You will likely receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.  During the procedure, the surgeon does the following:  - Inserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.  - Inspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.  - Repairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.    At the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.  Your surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : Arthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:  - Ankle pain: Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.  - Ligament tears: A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired with this type of surgery.  - Ankle impingement: Tissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint.  - Scar tissue: This can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue.  - Arthritis: Arthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement.  - Cartilage injuries: This surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries.  - Loose fragments: These are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up. During arthroscopy these fragments can be removed.\\n\\nRisks : Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clot, or infection    Risks of ankle arthroscopy are:  - Failure of surgery to relieve symptoms  - Failure of repair to heal  - Weakness of the ankle  - Injury to tendon, blood vessel, or nerve\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Tell your health care provider what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.  During the 2 weeks before your surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.  - Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - If you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see your doctor who treats you for these conditions.  - Tell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your health care provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.  - Tell your doctor about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.    On the day of surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.  - Take the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Follow instructions about when to arrive at the hospital. Arrive on time.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : - You can usually go home the same day after you recover from the anesthesia. You should have someone drive you home.  - Keep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain. You can also apply cold packs to reduce swelling.  - Keep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing.  - You can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your doctor says it is safe to do so.  - You will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : Arthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin. Compared to regular surgery, you may have:  - Less pain and stiffness  - Fewer complications  - Faster recovery    The small cuts will heal quickly, and you may be able to resume your normal activities in a few days. But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was.  You may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your doctor may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Ankle arthroplasty - total; Total ankle arthroplasty; Endoprosthetic ankle replacement; Ankle surgery)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007254.htm\\nAnswer: Ankle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain.   You may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.   Your surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side. After this:   - Your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage.    Your surgeon will replace the damaged part of:  - The lower end of your shin bone (tibia)  - The top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on  - The metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place.  - A piece of plastic is then inserted between the two metal parts.  - Screws maybe placed to stabilize your ankle.   The surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving.) \\n',\n",

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

(Also called: Septic arthritis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infectiousarthritis.html\\nAnswer: Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: What are the symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis ?\\nURL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/rheumatoidarthritis/toc.html\\nAnswer: Swelling and Pain in the Joints Different types of arthritis have different symptoms. In general, people with most forms of arthritis have pain and stiffness in their joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation of the joint lining. This inflammation causes warmth, redness, swelling, and pain around the joints. A person also feels sick, tired, and sometimes feverish. Rheumatoid arthritis generally occurs in a symmetrical pattern. If one knee or hand is affected, the other one is also likely to be affected. Diagnostic Tests Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages for several reasons. There is no single test for the disease. In addition, symptoms differ from person to person and can be more severe in some people than in others. Common tests for rheumatoid arthritis include - The rheumatoid factor test. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is present eventually in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis However, not all people with rheumatoid arthritis test positive for rheumatoid factor, especially early in the disease. Also, some people who do test positive never develop the disease. The rheumatoid factor test.

Surgery is often the first step and aims to remove as much of the cancer as possible.  Both a traditional surgical technique, known as wide local excision, and the newer Mohs micrographic surgery have been used to remove hidradenocarcinomas.  Radiation therapy, performed by a doctor known as radiation oncologist, has been used after surgery in patients with hidradenocarcinoma to destroy any cancer cells that may remain at the original location of the tumor or in the lymph nodes.

It narrows the arteries, which keeps blood from flowing well. Giant cell arteritis often occurs with another disorder called polymyalgia rheumatica. Both are more common in women than in men. They almost always affect people over the age of 50.    Early symptoms of giant cell arteritis resemble the flu: fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever. Other symptoms include       - Headaches    - Pain and tenderness over the temples    - Double vision or visual loss, dizziness    - Problems with coordination and balance    - Pain in your jaw and tongue       Your doctor will make the diagnosis based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical exam. There is no single test to diagnose giant cell arteritis, but you may have tests that measure inflammation.    Treatment is usually with corticosteroids. Early treatment is important; otherwise there is a risk of permanent vision loss or stroke. However, when properly treated, giant cell arteritis rarely comes back.

(Also called: Nonspecific back pain; Backache - chronic; Lumbar pain - chronic; Pain - back - chronic; Chronic back pain - low)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007422.htm\\nAnswer: Low back pain is common. Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.  A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.  Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:  - Heavy use from work or sports  - Injuries or fractures  - Surgery    You may have had a herniated disk, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time.  If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to spinal stenosis. These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease.   Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include:  - Curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis or kyphosis  - Medical problems, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis  - Piriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle    You are at greater risk for low back pain if you:  - Are over age 30  - Are overweight  - Are pregnant  - Do not exercise  - Feel stressed or depressed  - Have a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblaster  - Smoke) \\n',\n",

If you aren't sure, treat it as a major burn. Serious burns need immediate medical care. Call your local emergency number or 911.   MINOR BURNS  If the skin is unbroken:  - Run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area under water for at least 5 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will help reduce pain.  - Calm and reassure the person.  - After flushing or soaking the burn, cover it with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing.  - Protect the burn from pressure and friction.  - Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. Do NOT give aspirin to children under 12.  - Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion also can help.    Minor burns will usually heal without further treatment. Make sure the person is up to date on tetanus immunization.  MAJOR BURNS  If someone is on fire, tell the person to stop, drop, and roll. Then, follow these steps:  - Wrap the person in thick material; such as a wool or cotton coat, rug, or blanket. This helps put out the flames.  - Pour water on the person.   - Call 911 or your local emergency number.   - Make sure that the person is no longer touching any burning or smoking materials.  - Do NOT remove burned clothing that is stuck to the skin.  - Make sure the person is breathing. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.  - Cover the burn area with a dry sterile bandage (if available) or clean cloth. A sheet will do if the burned area is large. Do NOT apply any ointments. Avoid breaking burn blisters.  - If fingers or toes have been burned, separate them with dry, sterile, non-sticky bandage.  - Raise the body part that is burned above the level of the heart.   - Protect the burn area from pressure and friction.  - If an electrical injury may have caused the burn, DO NOT touch the victim directly. Use a non-metallic object to move the person away from exposed wires before starting first aid.   You will also need to prevent shock. If the person does not have a head, neck, back, or leg injury, follow these steps:   - Lay the person flat  - Raise the feet about 12 inches  - Cover the person with a coat or blanket    Continue to monitor the person's pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure until medical help arrives.) \\n\",\n",

The paralysis slowly improves. Botulism can be treated with an antitoxin which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood. Antitoxin for infants is available from the California Department of Public Health, and antitoxin for older children and adults is available through CDC.If given before paralysis is complete, antitoxin can prevent worsening and shorten recovery time. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the gut by inducing vomiting or by using enemas. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria followed by administration of appropriate antibiotics. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: What is (are) Burns ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/burns.html\\nAnswer: A burn is damage to your body's tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, sunlight or radiation. Scalds from hot liquids and steam, building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke.    There are three types of burns:       -  First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin     -  Second-degree burns damage the outer layer and the layer underneath    -  Third-degree burns damage or destroy the deepest layer of skin and tissues underneath       Burns can cause swelling, blistering, scarring and, in serious cases, shock and even death. They also can lead to infections because they damage your skin's protective barrier. Treatment for burns depends on the cause of the burn, how deep it is, and how much of the body it covers. Antibiotic creams can prevent or treat infections. For more serious burns, treatment may be needed to clean the wound, replace the skin, and make sure the patient has enough fluids and nutrition.

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Crying - excessive (0 to 6 months) (Also called: Excessive crying (infants 0 to 6 months))\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003023.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Infants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.\\n\\nCauses : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething\\n\\nHome Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying\\n\\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have? Such as, difficulty waking up, fever, irritability, poor appetite, or vomiting?    The provider will check the infant's growth and development. Antibiotics may be prescribed if the baby has a bacterial infection.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Feeding patterns and diet - children 6 months to 2 years\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000713.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : An age-appropriate diet:  - Gives your child proper nutrition  - Is right for your child's state of development  - Can help prevent childhood obesity\\n\\nRecommendations : 6 to 8 MONTHS  At this age, your baby will probably eat about 4 to 6 times per day, but will eat more at each feeding than the first 6 months.  - If you feed formula, your baby will eat about 6 to 8 ounces per feeding, but should not have more than 32 ounces in 24 hours.  - You can start to introduce solid foods at age 6 months. Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food) \\n\",\n",

Women who need to use transdermal estradiol for more than one of these reasons can benefit most from the medication. Women whose only bothersome symptoms are vaginal dryness, itching, or burning may benefit more from an estrogen product that is applied topically to the vagina. Women who only need a medication to prevent osteoporosis may benefit more from a different medication that does not contain estrogen. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are also sometimes used as a source of estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Estradiol is in a class of medications called estrogen hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body.  Menostar brand patches contain less estrogen than other brands of estradiol transdermal patches. Menostar patches are used only to prevent osteoporosis in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: How should Estradiol Transdermal Patch be used and what is the dosage ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html\\nAnswer: Transdermal estradiol comes as a patch to apply to the skin. Transdermal estradiol is usually applied once or twice a week, depending on the brand of patch that is used. Some women wear a patch all the time, and other women wear a patch according to a rotating schedule that alternates 3 weeks when the patch is worn followed by 1 week when the patch is not worn. Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you.  You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received. Do not apply any brand of estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out whether your patch should be applied to an area that will not be exposed to sunlight.  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities.  If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, throw it away in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day. Each brand of estradiol transdermal patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estradiol transdermal patch.   - Tear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.  - Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.  - Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.  - Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.  - Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and throw it away in a trash can that is out of reach of children and pets.  - Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion. Read the information that came with your patches to find out what to do if a substance is left on your skin after you remove your patch.   Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: What important warning or information should I know about Estradiol Transdermal Patch ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605042.html\\nAnswer: Estradiol increases the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus [womb]). The longer you use estradiol, the greater the risk that you will develop endometrial cancer. If you have not had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus), you should be given another medication called a progestin to take with transdermal estradiol. This may decrease your risk of developing endometrial cancer but may increase your risk of developing certain other health problems, including breast cancer. Before you begin using transdermal estradiol, tell your doctor if you have or have ever had cancer and if you have unusual vaginal bleeding. Call your doctor immediately if you have abnormal or unusual vaginal bleeding during your treatment with transdermal estradiol. Your doctor will watch you closely to help ensure you do not develop endometrial cancer during or after your treatment.  In a large study, women who took estrogens (a group of medications that includes estradiol) by mouth with progestins had a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the lungs or legs, breast cancer, and dementia (loss of ability to think, learn, and understand). Women who use transdermal estradiol alone or with progestins may also have a higher risk of developing these conditions. Tell your doctor if you smoke or use tobacco, if you have had a heart attack or a stroke in the past year, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had blood clots or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol or fats, diabetes, heart disease, lupus ( a condition in which the body attacks its own tissues causing damage and swelling), breast lumps, or an abnormal mammogram (x-ray of the breast used to find breast cancer).  The following symptoms can be signs of the serious health conditions listed above. Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms while you are using transdermal estradiol: sudden, severe headache; sudden, severe vomiting; speech problems; dizziness or faintness; sudden complete or partial loss of vision; double vision; weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg; crushing chest pain or chest heaviness; coughing up blood; sudden shortness of breath; difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, or learning new things; breast lumps or other breast changes; discharge from nipples; or pain, tenderness, or redness in one leg.  You can take steps to decrease the risk that you will develop a serious health problem while you are using transdermal estradiol. Do not use transdermal estradiol alone or with a progestin to prevent heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, or dementia. Use the lowest dose of transdermal estradiol that controls your symptoms and only use transdermal estradiol as long as needed. Talk to your doctor every 3 to 6 months to decide if you should use a lower dose of transdermal estradiol or should stop using the medication.  You should examine your breasts every month and have a mammogram and a breast exam performed by a doctor every year to help detect breast cancer as early as possible. Your doctor will tell you how to properly examine your breasts and whether you should have these exams more often than once a year because of your personal or family medical history.  Tell your doctor if you are having surgery or will be on bedrest. Your doctor may tell you to stop using transdermal estradiol 4 to 6 weeks before the surgery or bedrest to decrease the risk that you will develop blood clots.  Talk to your doctor regularly about the risks and benefits of using transdermal estradiol.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) Alcohol use and safe drinking ? (Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm\\nAnswer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered \"problem drinkers.\" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \"blood alcohol level.\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of \"being drunk\" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) \\n',\n",

This is the nerve that is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : This test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called nystagmus. The test is done in the following way:  - Before the test, your ear, especially the eardrum,will bechecked. This is to make sureit isnormal.  - One ear is tested at a time.  - A small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.  - Next, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back.  - Your other ear is tested in the same way.   During the test, the health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called electronystagmography.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid the following at least 24 hours before the test, because they can affect the results:  - Alcohol  - Allergy medicines  - Caffeine  - Sedatives   Do not stop taking your regular medicines without first talking to yourdoctor.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : You may find the cold water or air in the ear uncomfortable. You may feel your eyes scanning back and forth during nystagmus. You may have vertigo, and sometimes, you can also have nausea. This lasts only a very short time. Vomiting is rare.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : This test may be used to find the cause of:  - Dizziness or vertigo  - Hearing loss that may be due to certain antibiotics or other drugs   It may also be done to look for brain damage in persons who are in a coma.\\n\\nNormal Results : Rapid, side-to-side eye movements should occur when cold or warm water is placed into the ear. The eye movements should be similar on both sides.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : If the rapid, side-to-side eye movements do not occur even after ice cold water is given, there may be damage to the:  - Nerve of the inner ear  - Balance sensors of the inner ear  - Brain    Abnormal results may be due to:  - Poor blood supply to the ear  - Bleeding (hemorrhage)  - Blood clot  - Brain or brain stem damage  - Cholesteatoma  - Birth defects of the ear structure or brain  - Damage to the ear nerves  - Poisoning  - Rubella that damages the acoustic nerve  - Trauma    The test may also be done to diagnose or rule out:  - Acoustic neuroma  - Benign positional vertigo  - Labyrinthitis  - Meniere disease\\n\\nRisks : Too much water pressure can injure an already damaged eardrum. This rarely occursbecause the amount of water to be used is measured.  Water caloricstimulation should not be done if the eardrum is torn (perforated). This isbecause it can cause an ear infection. It also should not bedone during an episode of vertigo because it can make symptoms worse.) \\n',\n",

To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.\\n\\nCook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.\\n\\nInformation : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.) \\n\",\n",

Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.\\n\\nWhy you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.\\n\\nRisks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods.

One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.\\n\\nWhat you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.\\n\\nWhen to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000979.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.\\n\\nCauses : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.\\n\\nSymptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse\\n\\nTreatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Ear wax (Also called: Ear impaction; Cerumen impaction; Ear blockage)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000979.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : The ear canal is lined with hair follicles and glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.   Wax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.\\n\\nCauses : Ear wax protects the ear by:  - Trapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and smallobjects from entering and damaging the ear   - Protecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal   In some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeperand blockthe ear canal.\\n\\nSymptoms : - Earache  - Fullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged  - Noises in the ear (tinnitus)  - Partial hearing loss, may get worse\\n\\nTreatment : Most cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:  -  Baby oil   -  Commercial drops   -  Glycerin   -  Mineral oil   -  Water    Another method is to wash out the wax.   - Use body-temperature water (cooler or warmer water may cause brief but severe dizziness or vertigo).  - Hold your head upright andstraighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.  - Use a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.  - Tip your head to allow the water to drain. You may need to repeat irrigation several times.    To avoid damaging your ear or causing an infection:  - Never irrigate the ear if the eardrum may have a hole in it.  - Do not irrigate the ear with a jet irrigator designed for cleaning teeth (such as a WaterPik).    After the wax is removed, dry the ear thoroughly. You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.  You may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.  - Do not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears.  - Never try to clean the ear by putting any object, such as a cotton swab, into the ear canal.    If you cannot remove the wax plug or you have discomfort, consult a health care provider, who may remove the wax by:  - Repeating the irrigation attempts  -  Suctioning the ear canal   -  Using a small device called a curette   -  Using a microscope to help\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : The ear may become blocked with wax again in the future. Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed.  Rarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal or damage to the eardrum.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : See your health care provider if your ears are blocked with wax and you are unable to remove the wax.  Also call if you have an ear wax blockage and you develop new symptoms, such as:  - Drainage from the ear  - Ear pain  - Fever  - Hearing loss that continues afteryou cleanthe wax) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about After a C-section - in the hospital (Also called: Cesarean section - in the hospital)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000620.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Most women will remain in the hospital for 2 to 3 days after a cesarean delivery. Take advantage of the time to bond with your new baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby.\\n\\nWhat to Expect after a C-section : Right after surgery you may feel:  - Groggy from any medicines you received  - Nausea for the first day or so  - Itchy, if you received narcotics in your epidural    You will be brought to a recovery area right after surgery, where a nurse will:  - Monitor your blood pressure, heart rate, and the amount of your vaginal bleeding  - Check to make sure your uterus is becoming firmer  - Bring you to a hospital room once you are stable, where you will spend the next few days    After the excitement of finally delivering and holding your baby, you may notice just how tired you are, like the way one probably feels after running a marathon.  Your belly will be painful at first, but it will improve a lot over 1 to 2 days.  Some women feel sadness or an emotional letdown after delivery. These feelings are not uncommon. DO NOT feel ashamed. Talk with your health care providers and partner.\\n\\nSeeing and Caring for Your Baby : Breastfeeding can often begin right after surgery. The nurses can help you find the right position. Numbness from your anesthetic can limit your movement for a while, and pain in your incision can make it a little harder to become comfortable, but do not give up. The nurses can show you how to hold your baby so there is no pressure on your incision or abdomen.  Holding and caring for your new infant is exciting, making up for the long journey of your pregnancy and the pain and discomfort of labor. Nurses and breastfeeding specialists are available to answer questions and help you.  Also take advantage of the babysitting and room service the hospital provides for you. You are going home to both the joys of being a mother and the demands of caring for a newborn infant.\\n\\nActivity : Between feeling exhausted after labor and managing the pain from the surgery, getting out of bed may seem like too big of a task.  But getting out of bed at least once or twice a day at first can help speed your recovery. It also decreases your chance of having blood clots and helps your bowels move.  Make sure someone is around to help you in case you get dizzy or weak. Plan on taking your walks soon after you have received some pain medicine.\\n\\nContractions and Bleeding : Once you deliver, the heavy contractions are over. But your uterus still needs to contract to shrink back to its normal size and prevent heavy bleeding. Breastfeeding also helps your uterus contract. These contractions may be somewhat painful, but they are important.  As your uterus becomes firmer and smaller, you are less likely to have heavy bleeding. Blood flow should gradually become slower during your first day. You may notice a few smaller clots passing when the nurse presses on your uterus to check it.\\n\\nPain Relief : Your epidural, or spinal, catheter can also be used for pain relief after surgery. It may be left in for up to 24 hours after delivery.  If you did not have an epidural, you may receive pain medicines directly into your veins through an intravenous line (IV) after surgery.  - This line runs through a pump that will be set to give you a certain amount of pain medicine.  - Often, you can push a button to give yourself more pain relief when you need it.  - This is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA).    You will then be switched to pain pills that you take by mouth, or you may receive shots of medicine. It is ok to ask for pain medicine when you need it. Do not be shy.\\n\\nWhat Else? : You will have a urinary (Foley) catheter in place right after surgery, but this will be removed on the first day after surgery.  The area around your incision may be sore, numb, or both. Sutures or staples are usually removed around the second day, just before you leave the hospital.  At first you may be asked to only eat ice chips or take sips of water, at least until your health care provider is certain you are not likely to have very heavy bleeding. Most likely, you will be able to eat a light diet 8 hours after your C-section.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Buying and Caring for Baby Bottles and Nipples\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000804.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Whether you feed your baby breast milk, infant formula, or both, you will need to buy bottles and nipples. You have many choices, so it can be hard to know what to buy. Learn about the different options and how to care for bottles and nipples.\\n\\nHow to Choose Bottles and Nipples : The type of nipple and bottle you choose will mainly depend on which type your baby will use. Some babies prefer a certain nipple shape, or they may have less gas with certain bottles. Others are less fussy. Start by buying a few different types of bottles and nipples. That way, you can try them out and see what works best for you and your baby.\\n\\nNipples : Nipples can be made from latex or silicone.  - Latex nipples are softer and more flexible. But some babies are sensitive to latex, and it does not last as long as silicone.  - Silicone nipples last longer and tend to hold their shape better.    Nipples come in different shapes.  - They can be dome-shaped, flat, or wide. Flat or wide nipples are shaped more like a mother\\'s breast.  - Try different shapes to see which one your baby prefers.    Nipples come in different flow rates.  - You can get nipples that have a slow, medium, or fast flow rate. These nipples are often numbered, 1 is the slowest flow.  - Infants usually start with a smaller hole and slower flow. You will increase the size as your baby gets better at feeding and drinks more.  - Your baby should be able to get enough milk without having to suck too hard.  - If your baby is choking or spitting up, the flow is too fast.\\n\\nBaby Bottles : Baby bottles come in different materials.  - Plastic bottles are lightweight and will not break if dropped. If you choose plastic, it is best to buy new bottles. Reused or hand-me-down bottles may contain bisphenol-A (BPA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of BPA in baby bottles due to safety concerns.  - Glass bottles do not have BPA and are recyclable, but they can break if dropped. Some manufacturers sell plastic sleeves to prevent bottles from breaking.  - Stainless steel bottles are sturdy and will not break, but they may be more expensive.  - Disposable bottles have a plastic sleeve inside that you throw away after each use. The liner collapses as baby drinks, which helps prevent air bubbles. Liners save on cleanup, and are handy for traveling. But they add an extra cost, as you need a new liner for every feeding.    You can choose from several different bottle shapes and sizes:  - Standard bottles have straight or slightly rounded sides. They are easy to clean and fill, and you can easily tell how much milk is in the bottle.  - Angle-neck bottles are easier to hold. The milk collects at the end of the bottle. This helps prevent your baby from sucking in air. These bottles can be harder to fill and you need to hold them sideways or use a funnel.  - Wide bottles have a wide mouth and are short and squat. They are said to be more like a mother\\'s breast, so they may be a good option for babies who go back and forth between breast and bottle.  - Vented bottles have a venting system inside to prevent air bubbles. They are said to help prevent colic and gas, but this is unproven. These bottles have a straw-like inner vent, so you will have more parts to keep track of, clean, and assemble.    When your baby is small, start with the smaller 4- to 5-ounce bottles. As your baby\\'s appetite grows, you can switch to larger 8- to 9-ounce bottles.\\n\\nCleaning and Care : These tips can help you safely care for and clean baby bottles and nipples:  - When you first buy bottles and nipples, sterilize them. Place all of the parts in a pan covered with water and boil them for 5 minutes. Then wash with soap and warm water and air dry them.  - Clean bottles right after you use them so the milk doesn\\'t dry and become caked onto the bottle. Wash bottles and other parts with soap and warm water. Use a bottle and nipple brush to get at hard-to-reach areas. ONLY use these brushes on baby bottles and parts. Dry bottles and nipples on a drying rack on the counter. Make sure everything is completely dry before using again.  - If bottles and nipples are labeled \"dishwasher safe,\" you can wash and dry them in the top rack of the dishwasher.  - Throw out cracked or torn nipples. Small pieces of the nipple can come off and cause choking.  - Throw out cracked or chipped bottles, which can pinch or cut you or your baby.  - Always wash your hands thoroughly before handling bottles and nipples.) \\n',\n",

Drain opening agent poisoning can occur if a child accidentally drinks these chemicals, or if someone splashes the poison into the eyes when pouring it or breathes in the fumes of \"foaming\" drain openers.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.\\n\\nPoisonous Ingredient : - Hydrochloric acid  - Lye (sodium hydroxide or caustic soda)  - Potassium hydroxide  - Sulfuric acid\\n\\nWhere Found : - Drain cleaners or openers   Note: This list may not include all sources of drain opening agents.\\n\\nSymptoms : Blood:  - Severe change in acid level of blood (pH balance), which leads to damage in all of the body organs   Eyes, ears, nose, and throat   - Burns to the eyes, which may result in permanent vision loss  - Severe pain in the throat  - Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue   Gastrointestinal:  - Blood in the stool  - Burns and possible holes in thethroat (esophagus)  - Severe abdominal pain  - Vomiting  - Vomiting blood   Heart and circulatory system:  - Collapse  - Low blood pressure that develops rapidly   Lungs and airways:  - Breathing difficulty (from breathing in drain opening agent)  - Throat swelling (may also cause breathing difficulty)   Skin:  - Burns  - Holes (necrosis) in the skin or tissues underneath  - Irritation\\n\\nHome Care : Seek immediate medical help. Do NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional.  If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.  If the chemical was swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by a health care provider. Do NOT give water or milk if the patient is having symptoms (such as vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.  If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move him or her to fresh air.\\n\\nBefore Calling Emergency : Determine the following information:  - Patient\\'s age, weight, and condition  - Name of the product (ingredients and strengths, if known)  - Time it was swallowed  - Amount swallowed\\n\\nPoison Control : The National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) can be called from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.  This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  See: Poison control center - emergency number\\n\\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Room : The health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive:  - Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)  - Bronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs  - Chest x-ray  - EKG (heart tracing)  - Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach  - Fluids through the vein (by IV)  - Medicines for pain  - Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)  - Washing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery.  If this type of poison gets in the eye, it can be very dangerous and difficult to manage. Loss of vision is common. Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body.  Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Gallbladder removal - open (Also called: Cholecystectomy - open; Surgery - gallbladder - open)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002930.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Open gallbladder removal is surgery to remove the gallbladder through a large cut in your abdomen.\\n\\nDescription : Surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery:  - The surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs.  - The area is opened up so the surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs.  - The surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.  - The gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body.    An x-ray called a cholangiogram may be done during your surgery.   - To do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be outside your gallbladder.  - If other stones are found, the surgeon may remove them with a special instrument.   The surgery takes about 1 hour.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : You may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally.  Common symptoms may include:  - Indigestion, including bloating, heartburn, and gas   - Nausea and vomiting  - Pain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your belly (epigastric pain)    The most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely. In some cases, the surgeon needs to switch to an open surgery if laparoscopic surgery cannot be successfully continued.  Other reasons for removing the gallbladder by open surgery:  - Unexpected bleeding during the laparoscopic operation  - Obesity  - Pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas)  - Pregnancy (third trimester)  - Severe liver problems  - Past surgeries in the same area of your belly\\n\\nRisks : Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:  - Reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Bleeding, blood clots  - Infection   Risks of gallbladder surgery are:  - Damage to the blood vessels that go to the liver  - Injury to the common bile duct  - Injury to the small or large intestine  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Your may have the following tests done before surgery:  - Blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney tests)  - Chest x-ray or electrocardiogram (EKG), for some patients  - Several x-rays of the gallbladder  - Ultrasound of the gallbladder    Tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or might be pregnant  - Which drugs, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription    During the week before surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that may put you at a higher risk of bleeding during surgery.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.  - Prepare your homefor any problems you might have getting around after the surgery.  - You'll be told when to arrive at the hospital.    On the day of surgery:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Shower the night before or the morning of your surgery.  - Arrive at the hospital on time.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : You may stay in the hospital for3 to5 days after open gallbladder removal. During that time:  - You may be asked to breathe into a device called an incentive spirometer. This helps keep your lungs working well so that you do not get pneumonia.  - The nurse will help you sit up in bed, hang your legs over the side, and then stand up and start to walk.  - At first, you will receive fluids into your vein through an intravenous(IV)tube. Soon after, you will be asked to start drinking liquids and eating foods.  - You will be able to shower while you are still in the hospital.  - You may be asked to wear pressure stockings on your legs to help prevent a blood clot from forming. These stockings also help keep your blood circulating well.    If there were problems during your surgery, or if you have bleeding, a lot of pain, or a fever, you may need to stay in the hospital longer. Your doctor or nurses will tell youhow to care for yourselfafter you leave the hospital.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : Most people recover quickly and have good results from this procedure.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Infant formulas - overview (Also called: Formula feeding; Bottle feeding)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002447.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : During the first 4 to 6 months of life, infants need only breast milk or formula to meet all their nutritional needs. Infant formulas include powders, concentrated liquids, and ready-to-use forms.\\n\\nFood Sources : There are different formulas available for infants younger than 12 months old who are not drinking breast milk. While there are some differences, infant formulas sold in the United States have all the nutrients babies need to grow and thrive.  TYPES OF FORMULAS  Babies need iron in their diet. It's best to use a formula fortified with iron, unless your child's doctor says not to.  Standard cow's milk-based formulas:  - Almost all babies do well on cow's milk-based formulas.  - These formulas are made with cow's milk protein that has been changed to be more like breast milk. They contain lactose (a type of sugar in milk) and minerals from the cow's milk.  - Vegetable oils, plus other minerals and vitamins are also in the formula.  - Fussiness and colic are common problems for all babies. Most of the time, cow's milk formulas are not the cause of these symptoms. This means that you likely do not need to switch to a different formula if your baby is fussy. If you're not sure, talk with your infant's doctor.    Soy-based formulas:  - These formulas are made using soy proteins. They do not contain lactose.  - The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests using cow's milk-based formulas when possible rather than soy-based formulas.  - For parents who do not want their child to eat animal protein, the AAP recommends breastfeeding. Soy-based formulas are also an option.  - Soy-based formulas have NOT been proven to help with milk allergies or colic. Babies who are allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to soy milk.  - Soy-based formulas should be used for infants with galactosemia, a rare condition. These formulas can also be used for babies who can't digest lactose, which is uncommon in children younger than 12 months.    Hypoallergenic formulas (protein hydrolysate formulas):  - This type of formula may be helpful for infants who have allergies to milk protein and for those with skin rashes or wheezing caused by allergies.  - Hypoallergenic formulas are generally much more expensive than regular formulas.    Lactose-free formulas:  - These formulas are also used for galactosemia and for children who can't digest lactose.  - A child who has an illness with diarrhea usually will not need lactose-free formula.    There are special formulas for babies with certain health problems. Your pediatrician will let you know if your baby needs a special formula. DO NOT give these unless your pediatrician recommends it.  - Reflux formulas are pre-thickened with rice starch. They are usually needed only for infants with reflux who are not gaining weight or who are very uncomfortable.  - Formulas for premature and low-birth-weight infants have extra calories and minerals to meet the needs of these infants.  - Special formulas may be used for infants with heart disease, malabsorption syndromes, and problems digesting fat or processing certain amino acids.    Newer formulas with no clear role:  - Toddler formulas are offered as added nutrition for toddlers who are picky eaters. To date, they have not been shown to be better than whole milk and multivitamins. They are also expensive.    Most formulas can be purchased in the following forms:  - Ready-to-use. Do not need to add water; convenient, but cost more.  - Concentrated liquid formulas. Need to be mixed with water, cost less.  - Powdered formulas. Must be mixed with water, cost the least.\\n\\nRecommendations : The AAP recommends that all infants be fed breast milk or iron-fortified formula for at least 12 months.  Your baby will have a slightly different feeding pattern depending on whether she is breastfed or formula fed.  In general, breastfed babies tend to eat more often.   Formula-fed babies may need to eat about 6 to 8 times per day.  - Start newborns with 2 to 3 ounces of formula per feeding (for a total of 16 to 24 ounces per day).  - As with breastfeeding, the number of feedings will decrease as the baby gets older, but the amount of formula will increase to approximately 6 to 8 ounces per feeding.  - At 4 to 6 months of age, an infant should be consuming 28 to 45 ounces of formula and is often ready to start the transition to solid foods.   Infant formula can be used until a child is 1 year old. The AAP does not recommend regular cow's milk for children under 1 year old. After 1 year, the child should only get whole milk, not skim or reduced-fat milk.  Standard formulas contain 20 Kcal/ounce and 0.45 grams of protein/ounce. Formulas based on cow's milk are appropriate for most full-term and preterm infants.  Infants who drink enough formula and are gaining weight usually do not need extra vitamins or minerals. Your doctor or nurse may prescribe extra fluoride if the formula is being made with water that has not been fluorinated.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Eskalith toxicity; Lithane toxicity; Lithobid toxicity; Lithonate toxicity; Lithotabs toxicity)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002667.htm\\nAnswer: Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder (manic depression). This article focuses on lithium overdose, or toxicity.  - Acute toxicity occurs when you intentionally or accidentally swallow too much of a lithium prescription.  - Chronic toxicity occurs when you slowly take a little too much of a lithium prescription every day for a while. This is actually quite easy to do, as dehydration, other medications, and other conditions can easily interfere with lithium in your body and cause it to build up.  - Acute chronic toxicity occurs when you take lithium every day for bipolar disorder, but one day you take an extra amount (as little as a couple of pills or as much as a whole bottle).  - People taking lithium should have their blood levels monitored regularly. Some people can develop toxicity even when taking low dosages of lithium.   This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual poison exposure. If you have an exposure, you should call your local emergency number (such as 911) or the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222.  See: Overdose) \\n',\n",

Those who do not develop nervous system symptoms usually have no long-term complications.  If serious nervous system symptoms occur, you may have permanent neurologic problems.  Chronic toxicity is sometimes difficult to diagnose until late in the course. This delay can lead to long-term problems.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Open heart surgery (Also called: Heart surgery - open)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002950.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Open heart surgery is any surgery in which the chest is opened and surgery is done on the heart muscle, valves, arteries, or other parts of the heart (such as the aorta). The term \"open\" means that the chest is \"cut\" open.  The definition of open heart surgery has become less clear. New procedures are being done on the heart through smaller cuts. Some new procedures are being done while the heart is still beating.  Related topics include:  - Aortic valve surgery -- minimally invasive  - Aortic valve surgery -- open  - Atrial septal defect repair  - Cardiac transplant  - Coarctation of the aorta repair  - Congenital heart defect corrective surgery  - Heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft - CABG)  - Heart transplant  - Heart valve surgery  - Hypoplastic left heart repair  - Minimally invasive heart surgery (MIDCAB, OPCAB, RACAB)  - Mitral valve repair  - Mitral valve surgery -- minimally invasive  - Mitral valve surgery -- open  - Pediatric heart surgery  - Tetralogy of Fallot repair  - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return correction  - Transplant of the heart  - Transposition of great vessels repair  - Tricuspid atresia repair  - Truncus arteriosus repair  - Ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair\\n\\nDescription : A heart-lung machine is used in most cases during open heart surgery. While the surgeon works on the heart, the machine helps send oxygen-rich blood to the brain and other organs.  - Your heart surgeon will make a 5 to 8-inchsurgical cut in the chest wall. The breast bone is opened with a surgical saw to expose the heart. The surgeon can fix or replace a valve or perform bypass surgery.  - During endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes one to four small holes in your chest. Then your surgeon uses special instruments and a camera to perform the surgery.  - During robot-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes two to four tiny cuts (about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch) in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. The surgeon sees a three-dimensional view of the surgery on the computer. This method is very precise. However, it has not been proven so far to have better results than traditional surgery methods.    You will not need to be on a heart-lung machine for some types of surgery using smaller cuts. However, your heart rate may be slowed with medicine or a mechanical device used to position the heart to do the operation. If there is a problem with these procedures, the surgeon may have to open the chest to do the surgery.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Open lung biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - open lung)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003861.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : An open lung biopsy is surgery to remove a small piece of tissue from the lung. The sample is then examined for cancer, infection, or lung disease.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : An open lung biopsy is done in the hospital using general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat to help you breathe.  The surgery is done in the following way:  - After cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of your chest.  - The ribs are gently separated.  - Tissue is taken from the lung and sent to a laboratory for examination.  - After surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.  - Your surgeon may leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : You should tell the health care provider if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.   Follow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : When you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.   There will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain afterwards.  You may have a sore throat from the tube. You can ease the pain by eating ice chips.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : The open lung biopsy is done to evaluate lung problems seen on x-ray or CT scan.\\n\\nNormal Results : The lungs and lung tissue will be normal.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Benign tumors  - Cancer  - Certain infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal)  - Lung diseases (fibrosis)    The procedure may help diagnose a number of different conditions, such as:  - Rheumatoid lung disease  - Sarcoidosis  - Wegener granulomatosis\\n\\nRisks : There is a possibility of infection or an air leak into the chest.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Learn about gluten-free diets\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000813.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : On a gluten-free diet, you do not eat wheat, rye, and barley. These foods contain gluten, a type of protein. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment for celiac disease. Some people believe a gluten-free diet can also help improve other health problems, but there is little research to support this idea.\\n\\nReasons to Avoid Gluten : People follow a gluten-free diet for a number of reasons:  Celiac disease. People with this condition cannot eat gluten because it triggers an immune response that damages the lining of their stomach. This response causes inflammation in the small intestine and makes it hard for the body to absorb nutrients in food. Symptoms include bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.  Gluten sensitivity. People with gluten sensitivity do not have celiac disease. Eating gluten causes many of the same symptoms as in celiac disease, without the stomach damage.  Gluten intolerance. This describes people who have symptoms and may or may not have celiac disease. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea.  If you have one of these conditions, a gluten-free diet will help control your symptoms. It also helps prevent health problems in people with celiac disease.  Other health claims. Some people go gluten-free because they believe it can help control health problems such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, and weight gain. However, these claims are unproven.  Because you cut out a whole group of foods, a gluten-free diet can cause you to lose weight. However, there are easier diets to follow for weight loss. People with celiac disease often gain weight because their symptoms improve.\\n\\nHow it Works : On this diet, you need to learn which foods contain gluten and avoid them. This is not easy, because gluten is in many foods and food products.   Many foods are naturally gluten-free, including:  - Fruits and vegetables  - Meat, fish, poultry, and eggs  - Beans  - Nuts and seeds  - Dairy products    Other grains and starches are fine to eat, as long as they do not come boxed with seasonings:  - Quinoa  - Amaranth  - Buckwheat  - Cornmeal  - Millet  - Rice    You can also buy gluten-free versions of foods such as bread, flour, crackers, and cereals. These products are made with rice and other gluten-free flours. Keep in mind that they are often higher in sugar and calories and lower in fiber than the foods they replace.\\n\\nOff-Limit Foods : When following this diet, you must avoid foods that contain gluten:  - Wheat  - Barley (this includes malt, malt flavoring, and malt vinegar)  - Rye  - Triticale (a grain that is a cross between wheat and rye)    You must also avoid these foods, which contain wheat:  - Bulgur  - Couscous  - Durum flour  - Farina  - Graham flour  - Kamut  - Semolina  - Spelt    Note that \"wheat-free\" does not always mean gluten-free. Many foods contain gluten or traces of wheat. Read the label and only buy \"gluten-free\" options of:  - Bread and other baked goods  - Pastas  - Cereals  - Crackers  - Beer  - Soy sauce  - Seitan  - Breading  - Battered or deep-fried foods  - Oats  - Processed foods, including frozen foods, soups, and rice mixes  - Salad dressings, sauces, marinades, and gravies  - Some candies, licorice  - Some medicines and vitamins (gluten is used to bind the pill ingredients together)\\n\\nThe Role of Exercise : A gluten-free diet is a way of eating, so exercise is not included as part of the plan. However, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day on most days for good health.\\n\\nHealth Benefits : People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to prevent damage to their intestines.  Avoiding gluten will not improve your heart health if you do not eat healthy foods. Be sure to substitute plenty of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables in place of gluten.\\n\\nPossible Health Concerns : Many foods made with wheat flour are fortified with vitamins and minerals. Cutting out wheat and other grains can leave you short of nutrients like these:  - Calcium  - Fiber  - Folate  - Iron  - Niacin  - Riboflavin  - Thiamin   To get all the vitamins and minerals you need, eat a variety of healthy foods. Working with your health care provider or a dietitian can also help ensure you get proper nutrition.\\n\\nEase of Use : Because so many foods contain gluten, this can be a hard diet to follow. It can feel limiting when you shop or eat out. However, as the diet has become more popular, gluten-free foods have become available in more stores. Also, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free meals.\\n\\nWhere to Find More Information : The National Institutes of Health has a Celiac Awareness Campaignat celiac.nih.gov with information and resources.  You can find information on celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and gluten-free cooking from these organizations:  - Beyond Celiac - www.beyondceliac.org  - The Celiac Disease Foundation - celiac.org   There are also a number of books on gluten-free eating. Your best bet is to find one written by a dietitian.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Doctor : If you think you may have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, talk with your doctor. You should be tested for celiac disease, which is a serious condition.  If you have symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance, DO NOT stop eating gluten without first getting tested for celiac disease. You may have a different health condition that a gluten-free diet cannot treat. Also, following a gluten-free diet for several months or years may make it more difficult to accurately diagnose celiac disease. If you stop eating gluten before being tested, it will affect the results.) \\n',\n",

It can help you lose weight, relieve stress, and boost your mood. You also know it helps prevent heart disease and other health problems. But despite knowing these facts, you may still struggle to get regular exercise.  Improve your perception of exercise -- don't see it as just something you should do, but as something you want to do. Tailor your exercise routine, so it becomes something you actually look forward to doing.\\n\\nDo activities you enjoy : With so many options for exercise, there's no need to suffer through a workout you don't like.  - Be true to yourself. Look for activities that suit your personality. If you're a social butterfly, try group activities, such as dance classes, a cycling club, or a walking group. Many groups welcome new members at all levels. If competition is what drives you, take up softball or join a rowing club. If you prefer solo exercise, consider jogging or swimming.  - Try something new. There's a whole world of exercise possibilities out there, from salsa classes, to kayaking, to rock climbing. You never know what activities you might enjoy until you try them. So see what's available in your area and go for it. Whether it's horseback riding, belly dancing, or water polo, find an activity or sport that interests you and sign-up. If you find it hard to go alone, bring a friend or family member.  - Channel your inner child. Think about activities you enjoyed as a child, and try them again. Was it roller skating, dance, maybe basketball? You may be surprised at how much you still enjoy your childhood pastimes. Many communities have adult leagues and classes you can join.  - Choose your sweet spot. Do you love being outdoors? Choose activities that get you outside, such as walking, hiking, or gardening. If you prefer to exercise indoors, think about swimming, active video games, or yoga.  - Mix it up. Even the most fun activity can get boring if you do it day after day. Find a few things you like and mix it up. For example, you might play golf on a Saturdays, take tango classes on Mondays, and swim laps on Wednesdays.  - Add a soundtrack. Listening to music helps the time pass and keeps your pace up. Or you might try listening to audio books while you walk or ride a stationary bike. Just be sure the volume is low enough for you to hear what is going on around you.\\n\\nStay motivated : Getting started with a routine is just the first step. You will also need help staying motivated so that you keep up your new habits.  - Remind yourself how much you like exercising. Most people feel really good after exercising. But for some reason, it's hard to remember that feeling before your next workout. As a reminder, make a few notes about how good you feel after a workout. Or take a photo of yourself after a workout and stick it on the fridge for inspiration.  - Share your progress online. Social media offers a number of ways to share your progress and get positive feedback from friends. Look for websites where you can track your daily walk or run. If you like to write, start a blog about your adventures.  - Sign up for a charity event. Charity events offer you the chance to walk, ski, run, or bike for a good cause. Not only are these events fun, but training for them can help keep your motivation up. Many charities help participants by arranging training runs or bikes. You'll get fit while meeting new friends. Or, boost your motivation by signing up for the event with family, friends, or coworkers.  - Reward yourself. Treat yourself for hitting your goals. Think about rewards that support your efforts, such as new walking shoes, a heart rate monitor, or a GPS watch you can use to track your workouts.

It\\'s a normal and healthy reaction to change or a challenge. But stress that goes on for more than a few weeks can affect your health. Keep stress from making you sick by learning healthy ways to manage it.  LEARN TO RECOGNIZE STRESS  The first step in managing stress is recognizing it in your life. Everyone feels stress in a different way. You may get angry or irritable, lose sleep, or have headaches or stomach upset. What are your signs of stress? Once you know what signals to look for, you can start to manage it.  Also identify the situations that cause you stress. These are called stressors. Your stressors could be family, work, relationships, money, or health problems. Once you understand where your stress is coming from, you can come up with ways to deal with your stressors.  AVOID UNHEALTHY STRESS RELIEF  When you feel stressed, you may fall back on unhealthy behaviors to help you relax. These may include:  - Eating too much  - Smoking cigarettes  - Drinking alcohol or using drugs  - Sleeping too much or not sleeping enough    These behaviors may help you feel better at first, but they may hurt you more than they help. Instead, use the tips below to find healthy ways to reduce your stress.  FIND HEALTHY STRESS BUSTERS  There are many healthy ways to manage stress. Try a few and see which ones work best for you.  - Recognize the things you can\\'t change. Accepting that you can\\'t change certain things allows you to let go and not get upset. For instance, you cannot change the fact that you have to drive during rush hour. But you can look for ways to relax during your commute, such as listening to a podcast or book.  - Avoid stressful situations. When you can, remove yourself from the source of stress. For example, if your family squabbles during the holidays, give yourself a breather and go out for a walk or drive.  - Get exercise. Getting physical activity every day is one of the easiest -- and best -- ways to cope with stress. When you exercise, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. It can also help you release built-up energy or frustration. Find something you enjoy -- whether it is walking, cycling, softball, swimming, or dancing -- and do it for at least 30 minutes on most days.  - Change your outlook. Try to develop a more positive attitude toward challenges. You can do this by replacing negative thoughts with more positive ones. For example, rather than thinking, \"Why does everything always go wrong?\" change this thought to, \"I can find a way to get through this.\" It may seem hard or silly at first, but with practice you may find it helps turn your outlook around.  - Do something you enjoy. When stress has you down, do something you enjoy to help pick you up. It could be as simple as reading a good book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie, or having dinner with a friend. Or, take up a new hobby or class. Whatever you choose, try to do at least one thing a day that\\'s just for you.  - Learn new ways to relax. Practicing relaxation techniques is a great way to handle daily stress. Relaxation techniques help slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. There are many types, from deep breathing and meditation to yoga and tai chi. Take a class, or try learning from books, videos, or online sources.  - Connect with loved ones. Do not let stress get in the way of being social. Spending time with family and friends can help you feel better and forget about your stress. Confiding in a friend may also help you work out your problems.  - Get enough sleep. Getting a good night\\'s sleep can help you think more clearly and have more energy. This will make it easier to handle any problems that crop up. Aim for about 7 to 9 hours each night.  - Eat a healthy diet. Eating healthy foods helps fuel your body and mind. Skip the high-sugar snack foods and load up on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and lean proteins.  - Learn to say no. If your stress comes from taking on too much at home or work, learn to set limits. Ask others for help when you need it.    RESOURCES  If you can\\'t manage stress on your own, you may want to talk with your health care provider. Or consider seeing a therapist or counselor who can help you find other ways to deal with your stress. Depending on the cause of your stress, you also may find it helps to join a support group.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Learn to manage your anger\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000858.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Anger is a normal emotion that everyone feels from time to time. But when you feel anger too intensely or too often, it can become a problem. Anger can put a strain on your relationships or cause problems at school or work.   Anger management can help you learn healthy ways to express and control your anger.\\n\\nUnderstanding Anger : Anger can be triggered by feelings, people, events, situations, or memories. You may feel anger when you worry about conflicts at home. A bossy coworker or commuter traffic may make your angry.   When you feel anger, your blood pressure and heart rate go up. Certain hormone levels increase, causing a burst of energy. This allows us to react aggressively when we feel threatened.   There are always going to be things in life that make you angry. The problem is that lashing out is not a good way to react most of the time. You have little or no control over the things that cause your anger. But can you learn to control your reaction.\\n\\nWho Needs Anger Management : Some people seem to be more prone to anger. Others may have grown up in a household full of anger and threats. Excess anger causes problems both for you and the people around you. Being angry all the time pushes people away. It can also be bad for your heart and cause stomach problems, trouble sleeping, and headaches.  You may need help controlling your anger if you:  - Often get into arguments that spin out of control  - Become violent or break things when angry  - Threaten others when you are angry  - Have been arrested or jailed because of your anger\\n\\nHow Anger Management Works : Anger management teaches you how to express your anger in a healthy way. You can learn to express your feelings and needs while respecting others.  Here are some ways to manage your anger. You can try one or combine a few:  - Pay attention to what triggers your anger. You may need to do this after you calm down. Knowing when you may get angry can help you plan ahead to manage your reaction.  - Change your thinking. Angry people often see things in terms of \"always\" or \"never.\" For example, you may think \"you never support me\" or \"things always go wrong for me.\" The fact is, this is rarely true. These statements can make you feel that there is no solution. This only fuels your anger. Try to avoid using these words. This can help you see things more clearly. It may take a little practice at first, but it will get easier the more you do it.  - Find ways to relax. Learning to relax your body and mind can help you calm down. There are many different relaxation techniques to try. You can learn them from classes, books, DVDs, and online. Once you find a technique that works for you, you can use it whenever you start to feel angry.  - Take a time out. Sometimes the best way to calm your anger is to get away from the situation that is causing it. If you feel like you are about to blow up, take a few minutes alone to cool off. Tell family, friends, or trusted coworkers about this strategy ahead of time. Let them know you will need a few minutes to calm down and will return when you have cooled off.  - Work to solve problems. If the same situation makes you feel angry over and over, look for a solution. For example, if you get angry every morning sitting in traffic, look for a different route or leave at a different time. You could also try public transportation, riding your bike to work, or listening to a book or calming music.  - Learn to communicate. If you find yourself ready to fly off the handle, take a moment to slow down. Try to listen to the other person without jumping to conclusions. DO NOT respond with the first thing that pops into your mind. You may regret it later. Instead, take a moment to think about your answer.\\n\\nFor More Help : If you need more help dealing with your anger, look for a class on anger management or talk with a counselor who specializes in this topic. Ask your health care provider for suggestions and referrals.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Doctor : You should call your health care provider:  - If you feel like your anger is out of control  - If your anger is affecting your relationships or work  - You are concerned you might hurt yourself or others) \\n',\n",

Most people feel this way once in a while.  Clinical depression is a mood disorder. It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration get in the way of your life over a long period of time. It also changes how your body works.

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Learning about ventilators\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000458.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : A ventilator is a machine that breathes for you or helps you breathe. It is also called a breathing machine or respirator. The ventilator:   - Is attached to a computer with knobs and buttons that are controlled by a respiratory therapist, nurse, or doctor.  - Has tubes that connect to the person through a breathing tube. The breathing tube is placed in the person's mouth or in an opening through the neck into the windpipe (trachea). This opening is called a tracheostomy.  - Makes noise and has alarms that alert the health care team when something needs to be fixed or changed.\\n\\nHow Does Being on a Ventilator Feel? : A person receives medicine to remain comfortable while on a ventilator, especially if they have a breathing tube in their mouth. The medicine may cause people to be too sleepy to open their eyes.  People cannot talk because of the breathing tube. When they are awake enough to open their eyes and move, they can communicate in writing.  People on ventilators will have many wires and tubes on them. This may look scary, but these wires and tubes help to carefully monitor them.  Some people may have restraints. These are used to prevent them from pulling out any important tubes and wires.\\n\\nWhy are Ventilators Needed? : People are placed on ventilators when they cannot breathe on their own. This may be for any of the following reasons:  - To make sure the person is getting enough oxygen and is getting rid of carbon dioxide.  - After surgery, people may need a ventilator to breathe for them when they have had medicine that causes them to be sleepy and their breathing has not returned to normal.  - A person has an illness or injury and is not able to breathe normally.   Most of the time, a ventilator is needed only for a short time -- hours, days, or weeks. But in some cases, a ventilator is needed for months, or sometimes years.\\n\\nWhat Kind of Care Does a Person Need When on a Ventilator? : In the hospital, a person on a ventilator is watched closely by health care providers including doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists.  People who need ventilators for long periods may stay in long-term care facilities. Some people with a tracheostomy may be able to be at home.  Patients on a ventilator are watched carefully for lung infections. When connected to a ventilator, a person has a hard time coughing out mucus. If mucus collects, the lungs do not get enough oxygen. The mucus can also lead to pneumonia. To get rid of the mucus, a procedure called suctioning is needed. This is done by inserting a small thin tube into the person's mouth or neck opening to vacuum out the mucus.  When the ventilator is used for more than a few days, the person may receive nutrition through tubes into either a vein or their stomach.  Because the person cannot speak, special efforts need to be made to monitor them and provide them with other ways to communicate.) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Online health information - what can you trust?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000869.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : When you have a question about your or your family\\'s health, you may look it up on the Internet. You can find accurate health information on many sites. But, you are also likely to run across a lot of questionable, even false content. How can you tell the difference?  To find health information you can trust, you have to know where and how to look. These tips can help.\\n\\nWhat to Look For : With a bit of detective work, you can find information you can trust.  - Search for websites of well-known health institutions. Medical schools, professional health organizations, and hospitals often provide online health content.  - Look for \".gov,\" \".edu,\" or \".org\" in the web address. A \".gov\" address means the site is run by a government agency. A \".edu\" address indicates an educational institution. And a \".org\" address often means a professional organization runs the site. A \".com\" address means a for-profit company runs the site. It may still have some good information, but the content may be biased.  - Find out who wrote or reviewed the content. Look for health care providers such as doctors (MDs), nurses (RNs), or other licensed health professionals. Also look for an editorial policy. This policy can tell you where the site gets its content or how it is created.  - Look for scientific references. Content is more reliable if it is based on scientific studies. Professional journals are good references. These include the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the New England Journal of Medicine. Recent editions of medical textbooks are also good references.  - Look for the contact information on the site. You should be able to reach the site sponsor by telephone, email, or a mailing address.  - No matter where you find the information, check how old the content is. Even trusted sites may have out-of-date information archived. Look for content that is no more than 2 to 3 years old. Individual pages may have a date at the bottom that says when it was last updated. Or the home page may have such a date.  - Beware of chat rooms and discussion groups. The content in these forums is typically not reviewed or regulated. Plus it may come from people who are not experts, or who are trying to sell something.  - DO NOT rely on just one website. Compare the information you find on a site with content from other sites. Make sure other sites can back up the information you have found.\\n\\nThings to Keep in Mind : While searching for health information online, use common sense and be wary.  - If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Beware of quick-fix cures. And remember that a money-back guarantee does not mean that something works.  - As with any kind of website, it is important to be careful with your personal information. DO NOT give out your Social Security number. Before you buy anything, be sure that the site has a secure server. This will help protect your credit card information. You can tell by looking in the box near the top of the screen that cites the web address. At the start of the web address, look for \"https\".  - Personal stories are not scientific fact. Just because someone claims that their personal health story is true, it does not mean that it is. But even if it is true, the same treatment may not apply to your case. Only your health care provider can help you find the care that is best for you.\\n\\nWhere to Start : Here are a few high-quality resources to get you started.  - American Heart.org -- www.americanheart.org: Information on heart disease and ways to prevent disease. From the American Heart Association.  - Diabetes.org -- www.diabetes.org: Information on diabetes and ways to prevent, manage, and treat the disease. From the American Diabetes Association.  - Familydoctor.org -- familydoctor.org: General health information for families.

Produced by the National Library of Medicine as part of the National Institutes of Health.  - NIHSeniorHealth.gov -- www.nihseniorhealth.gov: Health information for older adults. From the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\nWhen to Call the Doctor : It is great that you are seeking information to help you manage your health. But keep in mind that online health information can never replace a talk with your health care provider. Talk to your provider if you have questions about your health, your treatment, or anything you read online. It can be helpful to print out the articles you have read and bring them with you to your appointment.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: how can botulism be prevented?\\nURL: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/botulism/\\nAnswer: Many cases of botulism are preventable. Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn and is caused by failure to follow proper canning methods. However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) \\n',\n",

If rodents don't find that where you are is a good place for them to be, then you're less likely to come into contact with them. Seal up holes and gaps in your home or garage. Place traps in and around your home to decrease rodent infestation. Clean up any easy-to-get food.\\n  \\nRecent research results show that many people who became ill with HPS developed the disease after having been in frequent contact with rodents and/or their droppings around a home or a workplace. On the other hand, many people who became ill reported that they had not seen rodents or rodent droppings at all.

(Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS))\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome\\nAnswer: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow by about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as hemihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.  The signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include abnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.  Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition and almost always appear in childhood.  Most children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: What are the genetic changes related to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS))\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome\\nAnswer: The genetic causes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are complex. The condition usually results from the abnormal regulation of genes in a particular region of chromosome 11. People normally inherit one copy of this chromosome from each parent. For most genes on chromosome 11, both copies of the gene are expressed, or \"turned on,\" in cells. For some genes, however, only the copy inherited from a person\\'s father (the paternally inherited copy) is expressed. For other genes, only the copy inherited from a person\\'s mother (the maternally inherited copy) is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting are responsible for most cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  At least half of all cases result from changes in a process called methylation. Methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, methylation is one way that a gene\\'s parent of origin is marked during the formation of egg and sperm cells. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (ICs). ICs control the methylation of several genes that are involved in normal growth, including the CDKN1C, H19, IGF2, and KCNQ1OT1 genes. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, which leads to overgrowth and the other characteristic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About twenty percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are caused by a genetic change known as paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Paternal UPD causes people to have two active copies of paternally inherited genes rather than one active copy from the father and one inactive copy from the mother. People with paternal UPD are also missing genes that are active only on the maternally inherited copy of the chromosome. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, paternal UPD usually occurs early in embryonic development and affects only some of the body\\'s cells. This phenomenon is called mosaicism. Mosaic paternal UPD leads to an imbalance in active paternal and maternal genes on chromosome 11, which underlies the signs and symptoms of the disorder.  Less commonly, mutations in the CDKN1C gene cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control growth before birth. Mutations in the CDKN1C gene prevent this protein from restraining growth, which leads to the abnormalities characteristic of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.  About 1 percent of all people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have a chromosomal abnormality such as a rearrangement (translocation), abnormal copying (duplication), or loss (deletion) of genetic material from chromosome 11. Like the other genetic changes responsible for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, these abnormalities disrupt the normal regulation of certain genes on this chromosome.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherited ? (Also called: BWS; Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS))\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome\\nAnswer: In about 85 percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, only one person in a family has been diagnosed with the condition. However, parents of one child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome may be at risk of having other children with the disorder. This risk depends on the genetic cause of the condition.  Another 10 to 15 percent of people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are part of families with more than one affected family member. In most of these families, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is typically sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, individuals with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherit the genetic change from their mothers. Occasionally, a person who inherits the altered gene will not have any of the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition.  Rarely, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome results from changes in the structure of chromosome 11. Some of these chromosomal abnormalities are inherited from a parent, while others occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in the earliest stages of development before birth.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Cholesterol - drug treatment\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000314.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Your body needs cholesterol to work properly. But extra cholesterol in your blood causes deposits to build up on the inside walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque. It narrows your arteries and reduces or stops blood flow. This can lead to heart attack, stroke, or narrowed arteries elsewhere in your body.    Statins are thought to be the best drugs to use for people who need medicines to lower their cholesterol.\\n\\nStatins for Cholesterol : Statins reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other related problems. They do this by lowering your LDL (bad) cholesterol.  Most of the time you will need to take this medicine for the rest of your life. In some cases, changing your lifestyle and losing extra weight may allow you to stop taking this medicine.\\n\\nWho Should Take Statins to Lower Cholesterol? : Having low LDL and total cholesterol reduces your risk of heart disease. But not everyone needs to take statins to lower cholesterol.  Your doctor will decide on your treatment based on:  - Your total, HDL (good), and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels  - Your age  - Your history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease  - Other health problems that may be caused by high cholesterol  - Whether or not you smoke  - Your risk of heart disease  - Your ethnicity    You should take statins if you are 75 or younger, and you have a history of:  - Heart problems due to narrowed arteries in the heart  - Stroke or TIA (mini stroke)  - Aortic aneurysm (a bulge in the main artery in your body)  - Narrowing of the arteries to your legs    If you are older than 75, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose of a statin. This may help lessen possible side effects.  You should take statins if your LDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher. You should also take statins if your LDL cholesterol is between 70 and 189 mg/dL and:  - You have diabetes and are between ages 40 and 75  - You have diabetes and a high risk of heart disease  - You have a high risk of heart disease    You and your doctor may want to consider statins if your LDL cholesterol is 70 to 189 mg/dL and:  - You have diabetes and a medium risk for heart disease  - You have a medium risk for heart disease\\n\\nHow low Should Your LDL Cholesterol be? : Doctors used to set a target level for your LDL cholesterol. But now the focus is reducing your risk for problems caused by narrowing of your arteries. Your doctor may monitor your cholesterol levels. But frequent testing is rarely needed.  Adding other drugs along with statins provides little to no benefit in most cases.  You and your doctor will decide what dose of a statin you should take. If you have risk factors, your doctor may prescribe higher doses. Factors that your doctor will consider when choosing the dose include:  - Your total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels before treatment  - Whether you have coronary artery disease (history of angina or heart attack), a history of stroke, or narrowed arteries in your legs  - Whether you have diabetes  - Whether you smoke or have high blood pressure    Higher doses may lead to side effects over time.

How can you find out the truth about your doctor? While many doctors are caring, professional, and competent, some are not. Fortunately, there are ways to check a doctor's credentials and standing. Use the resources below to learn about your doctor before you start working together. Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB)  The FSMB has a list of state medical board websites -- www.fsmb.org/pdf/GRPOL_Physician_Profiling.pdf. You can look up your doctor on the state site to see if he or she is licensed to practice in your state. Not all states provide the same amount of information. Some only share state license and board actions against the doctor. Others include actions taken in other states, medical malpractice, disciplinary actions, awards, and more. If your state doesn't provide this information, you may be able to request it.  Other health care providers, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants are also licensed by states. Most states have a similar search for all licensed medical providers.  For a more complete picture, you can order a doctor profile from the FSMB -- www.docinfo.org for $9.95. The FSMB collects data on doctors, osteopaths, and most physician assistants who are licensed to practice in the U.S. The profile includes:  - Physician disciplinary sanctions  - Education: medical school name, year of graduation, and degree earned  - Medical specialty  - Location information   HealthGrades  HealthGrades -- www.healthgrades.com gathers data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state medical boards. You can use this free website to get information about your doctor, as well as about local hospitals. You can get information on a doctor's:  - Experience  - Education and training  - Procedures performed  - Conditions treated  - Malpractice claims, sanctions, and board actions  - Awards  - Languages spoken    The site also collects patient satisfaction surveys from site users. NCQA Recognition Directory  The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) -- recognition.ncqa.org is a not-for-profit organization committed to improving health care quality. You can search their database of doctors to see who in your area participates in NCQA recognition programs. Participation means that the doctor is focused on providing quality care and follows the latest patient care methods. Prescriber Checkup and Dollars for Doctors  These pages are run by ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization. ProPublica produces investigative journalism in the public interest. Using Dollars for Doctors -- www.propublica.org/series/dollars-for-docs, you can check to see whether your doctor has received money from a drug company. With Prescriber Checkup -- projects.propublica.org/checkup, you can view your doctor's prescribing habits compared to the average doctor. These sites use prescribing data from Medicare Part D. This means that most of the information is based on prescriptions written for older adults and people with disabilities. These groups tend to use more prescription drugs. Some Things to Keep in Mind  While these sites can help you find out about your doctor, they are not foolproof. Most of the information you will find is from lawsuits that have been settled. If any complaints are still in process, you won't see them. Keep in mind that doctors in certain specialties may be more likely to be sued. And not all lawsuits mean that the doctor did something wrong.  Your health care provider may be a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. There are different sites to check on certification and specialization for these providers.  Use care when reviewing patient satisfaction scores. You are more likely to see telltale trends if a health care provider has been reviewed by 40 people rather than 4. Read the results closely. Poor scores for this office don't necessarily reflect on the health care provider, who may be one of many providers in a busy practice.) \\n\",\n",

Any use of these drugs is a form of drug abuse.  Legitimate medications can be abused by people who take more than the recommended dose or who intentionally take them with alcohol or other drugs.  Drug interactions may also produce adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to let your doctor know about all the drugs you are taking, including vitamins and other over-the-counter medications.  Many drugs are addictive. Sometimes the addiction is gradual. However, some drugs (such as cocaine) can cause addiction after only a few doses.  Someone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Withdrawal is greatly assisted by professional help.  A drug dose that is large enough to be toxic is called an overdose.

(Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm\\nAnswer: Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm\\nAnswer: The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.  Treatment may include:  -  Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching   -  Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)   -  Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)   - Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis    The offending medication and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your health care providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.  In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. The desensitization should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm\\nAnswer: There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.  If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the medication is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.  In some cases, a health care provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine). Do not try this without a health care provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent anaphylaxis in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about How to choose the best hospital for surgery\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007497.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : The quality of the health care you receive depends on many things besides the skill of your surgeon. Many health care providers at a hospital will be directly involved in your care before, during, and after surgery.  The work of all the hospital staff affects how well the hospital functions. This affects your safety and the quality of the care you will receive there.  CHOOSING THE BEST HOSPITAL FOR SURGERY  A hospital can offer many things to improve the quality of care you receive. For example, find out if your hospital has:  - A floor or unit that does only the type of surgery you are having (For example, for hip replacement surgery, do they have a floor or unit that is used only for joint-replacement surgeries?)  - Operating rooms that are used only for your type of surgery  - Specific guidelines so that everyone who has your type of surgery receives the kind of care they need  - Enough nurses    It can also be helpful to know how many surgeries like yours have been done at the hospital you have chosen or are considering for your surgery. People who have surgery at hospitals that do more of the same type of procedure often do better.  If you are having a surgery that involves newer techniques, find out how many of these procedures your hospital has already done.  HIGH-QUALITY MEASURES  Hospitals are asked to report events called \"quality measures.\" These measures are reports of different things that affect patient care. Some common quality measures include:  - Patient injuries, such as falls  - Patients who receive the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage of a medicine  - Complications, such as infections, blood clots, and pressure ulcers (bedsores)  - Readmission and death (mortality) rates    Hospitals receive scores for their quality. These scores can give you an idea of how your hospital compares to other hospitals.  Find out if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (a nonprofit organization that seeks to improve the quality and safety of health care).  Also see if your hospital is rated highly by state agencies or consumer or other groups. Some places to look for hospital ratings are:  - State reports -- some states require hospitals to report certain information to them, and some publish reports that compare hospitals in the state.  - Nonprofit groups in some areas or states work with businesses, doctors, and hospitals to gather information about quality. You can look for this information online.  - The government gathers and reports information about hospitals. You can find this information online at www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. You can also find information about choosing the best doctor online.  - Your health insurance company may rate and compare how different hospitals perform on the surgery you are having.

And, like many parents, you may be afraid that your teen may try drugs, or worse, become dependent on drugs.  While you cannot control everything your teen does, you can take steps to help your child stay away from drugs. Start by learning all you can about drugs and drug abuse. Learn the signs of drug use so that you can be alert. Then use these tips to help prevent drug use in your teen.\\n\\nInformation : First, learn about the different types of drugs that may be used. Older teens are more likely to use drugs than younger teens. Marijuana (pot) is still common. More and more teens are using prescription drugs.   WHY TEENS USE DRUGS   There are many reasons why teens might use drugs. Some common reasons include:  - To fit in. Social status is very important to teens. Your teen may do drugs in an attempt to fit in with friends or impress a new group of kids.  - To be social. Some teens use drugs because it lowers their inhibitions and makes them more comfortable socially.  - To deal with life changes. Change is not easy for anyone. Some teens turn to drugs to deal with situations such as moving, starting at a new school, puberty, or going through their parents\\' divorce.  - To ease pain and anxiety. Teens may use drugs to deal with problems with family, friends, school, mental health, or self-esteem.    TALKING WITH YOUR TEEN ABOUT DRUGS   It is not easy, but it is important to talk with your teen about drugs. It is one of the best ways to prevent teen drug use. Here are some tips:  - DO NOT make it one \"big talk.\" Instead, have ongoing conversations about drugs with your teen. Use news stories, TV shows, or movies as a starting point for conversations.  - DO NOT lecture. Instead, ask open-ended questions like, \"Why do you think those kids were using drugs?\" or, \"Have you ever been offered drugs?\" Your teen may respond in a more positive way if you have a real conversation.  - Let your teen know how you feel. Make it clear to your teen that you do not approve of drug use.  - Give your teen time to talk and listen without interrupting. This will show that you care about your child\\'s opinion.  - Spend some time every day talking about what is going on in your teen\\'s life.

HELP PREVENT DRUG USE   While there is no surefire way to make sure your teen never does drugs, you can steps to help prevent it.  - Stay involved. Build a strong relationship with your teen and show support for his or her interests.  - Be a good role model. Your own behaviors send a direct message to your teen, whether you know it or not. DO NOT use drugs, and use prescription medicines only as directed. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation.  - Meet and get to know your teen\\'s friends. If possible, meet their parents too. Encourage your teen to invite friends over so you can get to know them better. If you think a friend is a bad influence, do not hesitate to step in or encourage your child to make other friends.  - Set clear rules for your teen about drug use. This may include not riding in a car with kids who have been doing drugs and not staying at a party where anyone is doing drugs.  - Know what your teen is doing. Teens who are unsupervised are more likely to experiment with drugs. Keep tabs on where your teen is and who he or she is with. Ask your teen to check in with you at certain times of the day, such as after school.  - Encourage healthy activities. Hobbies, clubs, sports, and part-time jobs are all great ways to keep teens busy. By staying active, your teen will have less time to get involved with drug use.

       " \"Question: What important warning or information should I know about Ciprofloxacin ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a688016.html\\nAnswer: Taking ciprofloxacin increases the risk that you will develop tendinitis (swelling of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) or have a tendon rupture (tearing of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) during your treatment or for up to several months afterward. These problems may affect tendons in your shoulder, your hand, the back of your ankle, or in other parts of your body. Tendinitis or tendon rupture may happen to people of any age, but the risk is highest in people over 60 years of age. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a kidney, heart, or lung transplant; kidney disease; a joint or tendon disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function); or if you participate in regular physical activity. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking oral or injectable steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexpak), methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Sterapred). If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendinitis, stop taking ciprofloxacin, rest, and call your doctor immediately: pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle. If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendon rupture, stop taking ciprofloxacin and get emergency medical treatment: hearing or feeling a snap or pop in a tendon area, bruising after an injury to a tendon area, or inability to move or to bear weight on an affected area.  Taking ciprofloxacin may worsen muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness) and cause severe difficulty breathing or death. Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. Your doctor may tell you not to take ciprofloxacin. If you have myasthenia gravis and your doctor tells you that you should take ciprofloxacin, call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness or difficulty breathing during your treatment.  Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking ciprofloxacin.  Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ciprofloxacin. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

(Also called: Anemia - iron deficiency- infants and toddlers)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007618.htm\\nAnswer: Anemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.  A diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.  Babies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.   Breastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.  Infants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:  - Has less iron  - Causes small amounts of blood loss from the intestines  - Makes it harder for the body to absorb iron   Children older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Vertigo - positional; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; BPPV: dizziness- positional)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001420.htm\\nAnswer: Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.   The inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.  BPPV occurs when a small piece of bone-like calcium breaks free and floats inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.  BPPV has no major risk factors. But, your risk for developing BPPV may increase if you have:  - Family members with BPPV  - Had a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)  - Had an inner ear infection called labyrinthitis) \\n\",\n",

It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.\\n\\nCauses : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething\\n\\nHome Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom.

Infants with Emanuel syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Their development is significantly delayed, and most affected individuals have severe to profound intellectual disability.  Other features of Emanuel syndrome include an unusually small head (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Ear abnormalities are common, including small holes in the skin just in front of the ears (preauricular pits or sinuses). About half of all affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or a high arched palate. Males with Emanuel syndrome often have genital abnormalities. Additional signs of this condition can include heart defects and absent or unusually small (hypoplastic) kidneys; these problems can be life-threatening in infancy or childhood.) \\n',\n",

In addition to the usual 46 chromosomes, people with Emanuel syndrome have an extra (supernumerary) chromosome consisting of a piece of chromosome 11 attached to a piece of chromosome 22. The extra chromosome is known as a derivative 22 or der(22) chromosome.  As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder. Researchers are working to determine which genes are included on the der(22) chromosome and what role these genes play in development.) \\n',\n",

The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 that introduces extra genetic material in the form of the der(22) chromosome. This extra genetic material causes birth defects and the other health problems characteristic of this disorder.) \\n',\n",

In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4\\' 9\" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer\\'s instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner\\'s manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child\\'s size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child\\'s safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer\\'s instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby\\'s head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat\\'s harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat\\'s instructions), the vehicle\\'s own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle\\'s own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child\\'s upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child\\'s shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4\\' 9\" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner\\'s manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle\\'s lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.) \\n',\n",

CHILD DEVELOPMENT THEORIES  Cognitive (thought) development skills typical for toddlers include:  - Early use of instruments or tools  - Following visual (then later, invisible) displacement (moving from one place to another) of objects  - Understanding that objects and people are there, even if you can\\'t see them (object and people permanence)    Personal-social development in the toddler stage focuses on the child learning to adjust to society\\'s demands, while trying to maintain independence and a sense of self.   These milestones are typical of children in the toddler stages. Some variation is normal. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your child\\'s development.   PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  The following are signs of expected physical development in a toddler:  GROSS MOTOR SKILLS (use of large muscles in the legs and arms)  - Stands alone well by 12 months  - Walks well by 12 - 15 months (Ifa child is not walking by 18 months, he or she should be evaluated by a health care provider.)  - Learns to walk backwards and up steps with help at about 16 - 18 months  - Jumps in place by about 24 months  - Rides a tricycle and stands briefly on one foot by about 36 months    FINE MOTOR SKILLS (use of small muscles in hands and fingers)  - Makes tower of three cubes by around 15 months  - Scribbles by 15 - 18 months  - Can use spoon by 24 months  - Can copy a circle by 36 months    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  - Uses 2 - 3 words (other than Mama or Dada) at 12 - 15 months  - Understands and follows simple commands (such as \"bring to Mommy\") at 14 - 16 months  - Names pictures of items and animals at 18 - 24 months  - Points to named body parts at 18 - 24 months  - Begins to say his or her own name at 22 - 24 months  - Combines 2 words at 16 to 24 months (There is a range of ages at which children are first able to combine words into sentences. Talk to your child\\'s health care provider if the toddler cannot make sentences by 24 months.)  - Knows gender and age by 36 months    SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT  - Indicates some needs by pointing at 12 - 15 months  - Looks for help when in trouble by 18 months  - Helps to undress and put things away by 18 - 24 months  - Listens to stories when shown pictures and can tell aboutrecent experiences by 24 months  - Cantake partin pretend play and simple games by 24 - 36 months    BEHAVIOR  Toddlers are always trying to be more independent. This creates safety concerns as well as discipline challenges. The child must be consistently taught the limits of appropriate vs. inappropriate behavior.  When toddlers try out activities they haven\\'t yet mastered, they can get frustrated and angry. Breath-holding, crying, screaming, and temper tantrums may often occur.  It is important for a child at this stage to:  - Learn from experiences  - Rely on boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors    SAFETY  Toddler safety is very important.  - Parents need to be aware that the child can now walk, run, climb, jump, and explore. This new stage of movement makes child-proofing the home very important. Window guards, gates on stairways, cabinet locks, toilet seat locks, electric outlet covers, and other safety features are needed to keep the child safe.  - Put the toddler in a safety restraint (toddler car seat) when riding in a car.  - Do not leave a toddler unattended for even short periods of time. Remember, more accidents occur during the toddler years than at any other stage of childhood.  - Make clear rules about not playing in streets or crossing without an adult.  - Falls are a major cause of injury. Keep gates or doors to stairways closed, and use guards for all windows above the ground floor. Do not leave chairs or ladders in areas that are likely to tempt the toddler into climbing up to explore new heights. Use corner guards on furniture in areas where the toddler is likely to walk, play, or run.  - Poisoning is a common cause of toddler illness and death. Keep all medicines in a locked cabinet. Keep all toxic household products (polishes, acids, cleaning solutions, chlorine bleach, lighter fluid, insecticides, or poisons) in a locked cabinet or closet. Many household and garden plants, such as toad stools, may cause serious illness or death if eaten. Ask your child\\'s health care provider for a list of common poisonous plants.  - If someone in the household owns a firearm, make sure it is unloaded and locked in a secure place.  - Keep toddlers away from the kitchen with a safety gate, or place them in a playpen or high chair. This will eliminate the danger of burns from pulling hot foods off the stove or bumping into the hot oven door.  - Do not let toddlers play in water alone. A toddler may drown, even in shallow water in a bathtub. Parent-child swimming lessons can be another safe and enjoyable way for toddlers to play in water. Never leave a child unattended near a pool, open toilet, or bathtub. Toddlers cannot learn how to swim and cannot be independent near any body of water.    PARENTING TIPS  - The toddler years are for children to learn accepted rules of behavior. It is important for parents to be consistent both in modeling behavior (behaving the way you want your child to behave), and in pointing out inappropriate behavior in the child. Recognize and reward positive behavior. You can introduce time-outs for negative behavior, or for going beyond the limits you set for your child.  - The toddler\\'s favorite word may seem to be \"NO!!!\" It is important for parents not to fall into a pattern of negative behaviorusing yelling, spanking, and threats.  - Teach children the proper names of body parts.  - Stress the unique, individual qualities of the child.  - Teach the concepts of please, thank you, and sharing with others.  - Read to the child regularly. This will help develop verbal skills.  - Toddlers thrive on regularity. Major changes in their routine are hard for them. Toddlers should have regular nap, bed, snack, and meal times.  - Toddlers should not be allowed to eat many snacks throughout the day. Too many snacks can take away the desire to eat regular meals, which tend to offer more balanced nutrition.   - Traveling with a toddler or having guests at the house can disrupt the childs routine. This may make the child more irritable. In these situations, reassure the child and try to get back to a routine in a calm way.) \\n',\n",

Your health care provider will use a cotton swab to collect the sample from inside the outer ear canal. In some cases, a sample is collected from the middle ear during ear surgery.  The sample is sent to a lab and placed on a special dish (culture media).  The lab team checks the dish every day to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses have grown. More tests may be done to look for specific substances and determine the best treatment.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : You do not need to prepare for this test.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : Using a cotton swab to take a sample of drainage from the outer ear is not painful. However, ear pain may be present if the ear is infected.  Ear surgery is done using general anesthesia. You will be asleep and feel no pain.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : The test may be done if you or your child has:  - An ear infection that is not getting better with treatment  - An infection of the outer ear (otitis externa)  - An ear infection with a ruptured eardrum and draining fluid    It may also be done as a routine part of myringotomy.  Note: Ear infections are diagnosed based on symptoms rather than using a culture.\\n\\nNormal Results : The test is normal if there is no growth on the culture.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be a sign of infection by bacteria, virus, or fungus.

(Also called: OME; Secretory otitis media; Serous otitis media; Silent otitis media; Silent ear infection; Glue ear)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007010.htm\\nAnswer: The Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.  Otitis media with effusion (OME) and ear infections are connected in two ways:  - After most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.  - When the Eustachian tube is partially blocked, fluid builds up in the middle ear. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.    The following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid:  - Allergies  - Irritants (especially cigarette smoke)  - Respiratory infections    The following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:  - Drinking while lying on your back  - Sudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road)    Getting water in a baby\\'s ears will not lead to a blocked tube.  OME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.  Younger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:  - The tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.  - The tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that\\'s easy to block.  - Young children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses.    The fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (\"Glue ear\" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to berelated to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.) \\n',\n",

Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2 to 3 months.  Some children who have had repeat ear infections may receive a small, daily dose of antibiotics to prevent new infections.  You can make the following changes to help clear up the fluid behind the eardrum:  - Avoid cigarette smoke  - Encourage infants to breastfeed  - Treat allergies by staying away from triggers (such as dust). Adults and older children may be given allergy medications.    Most often the fluid will clear on its own. You doctor may suggest watching the condition for a while to see if it is getting worse before recommending treatment.  If the fluid is still present after 6 weeks, the doctor may recommend:  - Continuing to watch the problem  - A hearing test  - A single trial of antibiotics (if they were not given earlier)    If the fluid is still present at 8 to 12 weeks, antibiotics may be tried. These medicines are not always helpful.  At some point, the child's hearing should be tested.  If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.  If the fluid is still present after 4 to 6 months, tubes are probably needed, even if there is no major hearing loss.

Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday. Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common.    The infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid.    If your child isn\\'t old enough to say \"My ear hurts,\" here are a few things to look for       - Tugging at ears    - Crying more than usual    - Fluid draining from the ear    - Trouble sleeping    - Balance difficulties    - Hearing problems       Your health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.    Often, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics.     Children who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.

(Also called: Allergic reaction - drug (medication); Drug hypersensitivity; Medication hypersensitivity)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000819.htm\\nAnswer: Adverse reactions to drugs are common. (adverse means unwanted or unexpected.) Almost any drug can cause an adverse reaction. Reactions range from irritating or mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  A true drug allergy is caused by a series of chemical steps in the body that produce the allergic reaction to a medication.  The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. However, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) called IgE against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the IgE tells your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine, which causes your allergy symptoms. A drug allergy may also occur without your body producing IgE. Instead, it might produce other types of antibodies, or have other reactions that do not produce antibodies.  Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medication or vaccine.  Common allergy-causing drugs include:  -  Anticonvulsants   -  Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin)   -  Iodinated (containing iodine) x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)   -  Penicillin and related antibiotics   -  Sulfa drugs    Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause nonallergic hives or trigger asthma. Some drug reactions are considered idiosyncratic. This means the reaction is an unusual effect of the medication. It is not due to a known chemical effect of the drug. Many people confuse an uncomfortable, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a true drug allergy.) \\n\",\n",

In the kidney, 25-hydroxy vitamin D changes into an active form of the vitamin. The active form of vitamin D helps control calcium and phosphate levels in the body.  This article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : Usually you will not need to fast. However, this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used.\\n\\nHow the Test Will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : This test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood.\\n\\nNormal Results : The normal range of vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Many experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL. Others recommend a level between 30 and 50 ng/mL.  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Lower-than-normal levels can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:  - Lack of exposure to sunlight  - Lack of enough vitamin D in the diet  - Liver and kidney diseases  - Poor food absorption  - Use of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin    Low vitamin D levels are more common in African-American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only. Low vitamin D levels have also been associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. For more information, see the article on vitamin D deficiency.  Higher-than-normal levelsmay be due to excess vitamin D, a condition called hypervitaminosis D.\\n\\nRisks : Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.

It also is used to treat people who have had a heart attack. Carvedilol is often used in combination with other medications. Carvedilol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure   High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) Drug Reactions ? (Also called: Side effects)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugreactions.html\\nAnswer: Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions.    One problem is interactions, which may occur between       - Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners    - Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit    - Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners    - Drugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers       Interactions can change the actions of one or both drugs. The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.    Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs. Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug. Others can be more serious.    Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can be mild or life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.    When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medications and foods you need to avoid. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: How should Carvedilol be used and what is the dosage ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697042.html\\nAnswer: Carvedilol comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day with food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning with food. Try to take carvedilol at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take carvedilol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Swallow the extended-release capsules whole. Do not chew or crush the capsules, and do not divide the beads inside a capsule into more than one dose. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you may carefully open a capsule and sprinkle all of the beads it contains over a spoonful of cool or room temperature applesauce. Swallow the entire mixture immediately without chewing.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of carvedilol and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. Talk to your doctor about how you feel and about any symptoms you experience during this time.  Carvedilol may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue taking carvedilol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking carvedilol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking carvedilol, you may experience serious heart problems such as severe chest pain, a heart attack, or an irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually over 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will watch you carefully and will probably tell you to avoid physical activity during this time.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: Are there interactions between Glucosamine hydrochloride and other medications ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/747.html\\nAnswer: Major       Do not take this combination.       Warfarin (Coumadin)       Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. There are several reports showing that taking glucosamine hydrochloride with or without chondroitin increases the effect of warfarin (Coumadin) on blood clotting. This can cause bruising and bleeding that can be serious. Don't take glucosamine hydrochloride if you are taking warfarin (Coumadin).       Moderate       Be cautious with this combination.       Medications for cancer (Antimitotic chemotherapy)       Some medications for cancer work by decreasing how fast cancer cells can copy themselves. Some scientists think that glucosamine might increase how fast tumor cells can copy themselves. Taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with some medications for cancer might decrease the effectiveness of these medications.         Some medications used for cancer include etoposide (VP16, VePesid) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin).       Minor       Be watchful with this combination.       Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others)       There is some concern that taking glucosamine hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) together might affect how well each works. However, more information is needed to know if this interaction is a big concern.       Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)       There has been concern that glucosamine hydrochloride might increase blood sugar in people with diabetes. There has also been concern that glucosamine hydrochloride might decrease how well medications used for diabetes work. However, research now indicates that glucosamine hydrochloride probably does not increase blood sugar in people with diabetes. Therefore, glucosamine hydrochloride probably does not interfere with diabetes medications. To be cautious, if you take glucosamine hydrochloride and have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar closely.         Some medications used for diabetes include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), tolbutamide (Orinase), and others.) \\n\",\n",

The medication is usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning. This medication may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep if it is taken in the evening. Take phentermine and topiramate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take phentermine and topiramate exactly as directed.  Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of phentermine and topiramate and increase your dose after 14 days. After you take this dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, your doctor may tell you to stop taking phentermine and topiramate or may increase your dose and then increase it again after 14 days. After you take the new dose for 12 weeks, your doctor will check to see how much weight you have lost. If you have not lost a certain amount of weight, it is not likely that you will benefit from taking phentermine and topiramate, so your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking the medication.  Phentermine and topiramate may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.  Phentermine and topiramate will help control your weight only as long as you continue to take the medication. Do not stop taking phentermine and topiramate without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking phentermine and topiramate, you may experience seizures. Your doctor will tell you how to decrease your dose gradually.  Phentermine and topiramate is not available at retail pharmacies. This medication is available only through specific mail order pharmacies. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.

You can help by trying to understand how the person with dementia perceives his or her world. Give the person a chance to talk about any challenges and take part in his or her own daily care.  Start by talking with your loved one's health care provider. Ask how you can:  - Help the person stay calm and oriented  - Make dressing and grooming easier  - Talk to the person  - Help with memory loss  - Manage behavior and sleep problems   Tips for reducing confusion in people with dementia include:  - Have familiar objects and people around.  - Keep lights on at night.  - Use reminders, notes, lists of routine tasks, or directions for daily activities.  - Stick to a simple activity schedule.    Taking regular walks with a caregiver can help improve communication skills and prevent wandering.  Calming music may reduce wandering and restlessness, ease anxiety, and improve sleep and behavior.  People with dementia should have their eyes and ears checked. If problems are found, hearing aids, glasses, or cataract surgery may be needed.  People with dementia should also have regular driving tests. At some point, it won't be safe for them to continue to drive. This may not be an easy conversation, so seek help from their provider and other family members. State laws vary on the ability of a person with dementia to continue to drive.  Supervised meals can help with feeding. People with dementia often forget to eat and drink, and can become dehydrated as a result. Talk to the provider about the need for extra calories due to increased physical activity from restlessness and wandering.  Also talk to the provider about:  - Watching for risk of choking and what to do if choking occurs  - How to increase safety in the home  - How to prevent falls  - Ways to improve bathroom safety    The Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return Program requires people with dementia to wear an identification bracelet. If they wander, their caregiver can contact the police and the national Safe Return office, where information about them is stored and shared nationwide.  Eventually, people with dementia may need 24-hour monitoring and assistance to provide a safe environment, control aggressive or agitated behavior, and meet their needs.  LONG-TERM CARE  A person with dementia may need monitoring and help at home or in an institution. Possible options include:  - Adult day care  - Boarding homes  - Nursing homes  - In-home care    Many organizations are available to help you care for a person with dementia. They include:  - Adult protective services  - Community resources  - Local or state government departments of aging  - Visiting nurses or aides  - Volunteer services    In some communities, dementia-related support groups may be available. Family counseling can help family members cope with home care.  Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to decide on care for the person with dementia. Seek legal advice early, before the person is unable to make these decisions.  There are support groups that can provide information and resources for people with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers.) \\n\",\n",

The degree of intellectual disability varies from mild to moderate. People with Down syndrome may also be born with various health concerns such as heart defects or digestive abnormalities. They also have an increased risk to develop gastroesophageal reflux, celiac disease, hypothyroidism, hearing and vision problems, leukemia, and Alzheimer disease. Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of chromosome 21 (called trisomy 21) instead of the usual two copies and is typically not inherited. Treatment focuses on the specific symptoms in each person.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Trisomy 21; Down's syndrome)\\nURL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome\\nAnswer: What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome? People with Down syndrome may develop the following medical problems:  Congenital hypothyroidism Hearing loss Congenital heart defects Seizures Vision disorders Decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) Children with Down syndrome are also more likely to develop chronic respiratory infections, middle ear infections, and recurrent tonsillitis. In addition, there is a higher incidence of pneumonia in children with Down syndrome than in the general population. Children with Down syndrome have developmental delay. They are often slow to turn over, sit, and stand. Developmental delay may be related to the child's weak muscle tone. Development of speech and language may also take longer than expected. Children with Down syndrome may take longer than other children to reach their developmental milestones, but many of these milestones will eventually be met. Adults with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease, a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function. Although Alzheimer disease is usually a disorder that occurs in older adults, about half of adults with Down syndrome develop this condition by age 50. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Down syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Acute megakaryocytic leukemia - Aganglionic megacolon - Anal atresia - Atlantoaxial instability - Brachycephaly - Broad palm - Brushfield spots - Complete atrioventricular canal defect - Conductive hearing impairment - Duodenal stenosis - Epicanthus - Flat face - Hypoplastic iliac wing - Hypothyroidism - Intellectual disability - Joint laxity - Macroglossia - Malar flattening - Microtia - Muscular hypotonia - Myeloproliferative disorder - Protruding tongue - Shallow acetabular fossae - Short middle phalanx of the 5th finger - Short palm - Short stature - Single transverse palmar crease - Sporadic - Thickened nuchal skin fold - Upslanted palpebral fissure - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: What causes Down syndrome ? (Also called: Trisomy 21; Down\\'s syndrome)\\nURL: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome\\nAnswer: What causes Down syndrome? There are 3 possible genetic causes of Down syndrome: Trisomy 21. Most often, Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all cells of the affected person.  In these cases, the chromosome 21 pair fails to separate during the formation of an egg (or sperm); this is called \"nondisjunction.\" When the egg with 2 copies of chromosome 21 unites with a normal sperm with one copy of chromosome 21 to form an embryo, the resulting embryo has 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two. The extra chromosome is then copied in every cell of the baby\\'s body, causing the features of Down syndrome. The cause of nondisjunction is unknown, but research has shown that it happens more often as women age. Nondisjunction is not known to be caused by anything in the environment or anything that parents do (or don\\'t do) before or during pregnancy. Mosaic trisomy 21. In about 1-2% of cases, only some of the cells in a person\\'s body have an extra chromosome 21; this is called \"mosaic trisomy 21\".  In this situation, the fertilized egg may have the right number of chromosomes, but due to a cell division error early in the development of the embryo, some cells \"acquire\" an extra chromosome 21. A person with mosaic trisomy 21 typically has 46 chromosomes in some cells, and 47 chromosomes (with the extra chromosome 21) in others. The features and severity in people with mosaic trisomy 21 may vary widely.  Translocation trisomy 21. About 3-4% of people with Down syndrome have cells that contain 46 chromosomes; however, there is extra chromosome 21 material attached (translocated ) onto another chromosome.  For parents of a child with Down syndrome due to a translocation, there may be an increased chance of Down syndrome in future pregnancies. This is because one of the two parents may be a carrier of a balanced translocation. However, not all parents of people with translocation trisomy 21 have a translocation. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person has, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of chromosome 21 present in all or some of their cells. This extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: What are the genetic changes related to Down syndrome ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/down-syndrome\\nAnswer: Most cases of Down syndrome result from trisomy 21, which means each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies.  Less commonly, Down syndrome occurs when part of chromosome 21 becomes attached (translocated) to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in a parent or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 21 plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome, resulting in three copies of genetic material from chromosome 21. Affected individuals with this genetic change are said to have translocation Down syndrome.  A very small percentage of people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21 in only some of the body's cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic Down syndrome.  Researchers believe that having extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupts the course of normal development, causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of health problems associated with this condition.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: Is Down syndrome inherited ? (Also called: 47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; Down's syndrome; trisomy 21; trisomy G)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/down-syndrome\\nAnswer: Most cases of Down syndrome are not inherited. When the condition is caused by trisomy 21, the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in a parent. The abnormality usually occurs in egg cells, but it occasionally occurs in sperm cells. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 21. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 21 in each of the body's cells.  People with translocation Down syndrome can inherit the condition from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, as this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. People who inherit an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome 21 may have extra genetic material from chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome.  Like trisomy 21, mosaic Down syndrome is not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in fetal development. As a result, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 21, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome.) \\n\",\n",

Symptoms include either variable changes in behavior (e.g., impulsive, bored, listless, lack of social contact, lack of empathy, distractibility, blunted emotions, compulsive behavior, decreased energy and motivation) or problems with language (e.g., difficulty making or understanding speech). Spatial skills and memory remain intact. There is a strong genetic component to the disease; it often runs in families. There is no cure for frontotemporal dementia at this time, as a result treatment remains supportive. Although the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century, the current classification of the syndrome groups together Picks disease, primary progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia as FTD. Some doctors propose adding corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex.

(Also called: MID; Dementia - multi-infarct; Dementia - post-stroke; Multi-infarct dementia)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000746.htm\\nAnswer: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease in people over age 65. MID usually affects people between ages 55 and 75. More men than women have vascular dementia.  Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.  - A stroke is an interruption in or blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.  - If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.  - When these strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms of a stroke. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.  - Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.    Risk factors for vascular dementia include:  - Diabetes  - Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Smoking  - Stroke   Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.) \\n',\n",

In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from one affected parent.  The inheritance pattern of late-onset Alzheimer disease is uncertain. People who inherit one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele are at even greater risk.

       " 'Question: What is (are) Dementia ?\\nURL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dementias/dementia.htm\\nAnswer: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Sleep apnea - pediatric; Apnea - pediatric sleep apnea syndrome; Sleep-disordered breathing - pediatric)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007660.htm\\nAnswer: During sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.  Normally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often this is because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.  Other factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:  - A small jaw  - Certain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)   - Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway  - Obesity  - Poor muscle tone due to conditions such as Down syndrome or cerebral palsy) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: What causes Central sleep apnea ? (Also called: Sleep apnea - central)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003997.htm\\nAnswer: Central sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that control breathing.   The condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems. For example, it can develop insomeone who hasa problem with the brainstem, which controls breathing.  Conditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:  - Problems that affect the brainstem (the brainstem controls breathing) including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)  - Parkinson disease  - Obesity  - Certain medicines,such as narcotic painkillers  - Heart failure   If the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.  A condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can mimic central sleep apnea. This involves breathing to a variable depth, usually while sleeping.  Central sleep apnea is not the same as obstructive sleep apnea. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. But a person can have both conditions, such as with a medical problem called obesity hypoventilation syndrome.) \\n',\n",

If needed, surgery also may be used to:  - Remove extra tissue at the back of the throat  - Correct problems with the structures in the face  - Create an opening in the windpipe to bypass the blocked airway if there are physical problems    Sometimes, surgery is not recommended or does not help. In that case, your child my use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.  - The child wears a mask over their nose during sleep.  - The mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of the bed.  - The machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into the airway during sleep. This helps keep the airway open.    It can take some time to get used to sleeping using CPAP therapy. Good follow-up and support from a sleep center can help your child overcome any problems using CPAP.  Other treatments may include:  - Inhaled nasal steroids.  - Dental device.

       " 'Question: What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?\\nURL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sleep_apnea/sleep_apnea.htm\\nAnswer: Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. These episodes usually last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. People with sleep apnea will partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they will not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep. The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. Central sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brains normal signals to breathe. Most people with sleep apnea will have a combination of both types. The hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, anxiety, and depression. Not everyone who has these symptoms will have sleep apnea, but it is recommended that people who are experiencing even a few of these symptoms visit their doctor for evaluation.

It may be done to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe snoring.\\n\\nDescription : Surgery known as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) removes soft tissue at the back of the throat. This includes:  - All or part of the uvula (the soft flap of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth).  - Parts of the soft palate and tissue at the sides of the throat.  - Tonsils and adenoids, if they are still there.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : Your doctor may recommend this surgery if you have mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  - Try lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or changing your sleep position.  - Most experts recommend trying to use CPAP or an oral device to treat OSA first.    Your doctor may recommend this surgery to treat severe snoring, even if you do not have OSA. Before you decide about this surgery:  - See if weight loss helps your snoring.  - Consider how important it is to you to treat snoring. The surgery does not work for everyone.  - Make sure your insurance will pay for this surgery. If you do not also have OSA, your insurance may not cover the surgery.    Sometimes, UPPP is done along with other more invasive surgeries to treat more severe OSA.\\n\\nRisks : Risks for any surgery are:  - Allergic reactions to medicines  - Breathing problems  - Heart problems  - Bleeding  - Infection    Risks for this surgery are:  - Damage to the muscles in the throat and soft palate. You may have some problems keeping liquids from coming up through your nose when drinking (called velopharyngeal insufficiency). Most often, this is only a temporary side effect.  - Mucus in the throat  - Speech changes\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What drugs you are taking, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription  - If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day   During the days before the surgery:  - You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other drugs that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which drugs you should still take on the day of your surgery.   On the day of the surgery:  - You will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery.  - Take any drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : This surgery most often requires an overnight stay in the hospital to make sure you can swallow. UPPP surgery can be painful and full recovery takes 2 or 3 weeks.  - Your throat will be very sore for up to several weeks. You will get liquid pain medicines to ease the soreness.  - You may have stitches in the back of your throat. These will dissolve or your doctor will remove them at the first follow-up visit.  - Eat only soft foods and liquids for the first 2 weeks after surgery. Avoid crunchy foods or foods that are hard to chew.  - You will need to rinse your mouth after meals with a salt-water solution for the first 7 to 10 days.  - Avoid heavy lifting or straining for the first 2 weeks. You may walk and do light activity after 24 hours.  - You will have a follow-up visit with your doctor 2 or 3 weeks after the surgery.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : Sleep apnea improves at first for about half of the people who have this surgery. Over time, the benefit wears off for many people.  Some studies suggest that surgery is best suited only for people with abnormalities in the soft palate.) \\n',\n",

This article talks about the medical test used to determine bowel transit time.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : You will be asked to swallow two gelatin capsules filled with a colored food dye. You take these capsules with a meal.  Afterwards, you observe your bowel movements and write down how long it takes for the colored dye to first appear. You'll also need to note how long it takes for the color to disappear from the stools.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : In most cases, you do not need to prepare for this test. However, you should follow any diet or other directions from the health care provider.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : You will not feel the capsules move through your digestive system.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : The test helps determine bowel function.  Your doctor may ask you to record transit times as you introduce fiber into your diet. Your diet affects the bowel transit time. For example, if you eat a lot of foods rich in fiber (whole grains, vegetables, and fruits), you will have a more rapid transit time and a heavier, bulkier stool.\\n\\nNormal Results : The bowel transit time varies, even in the same person.

These simple changes can make your days easier and preserve your strength.  - Ask for help when you need it.  - Give yourself more time for daily activities.  - Take breaks to catch your breath when you need to.  - Stay physically and mentally active.  - Set up your house so things you use every day are easily within reach.    Learn how to recognize and manage COPD flare-ups.\\n\\nClear the air : Your lungs need clean air. So if you smoke, the best thing you can do for your lungs is quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about ways to quit. Ask about support groups and other stop-smoking strategies.  Even second-hand smoke can cause further damage. So ask other people not to smoke around you.  You should also avoid other forms of pollution like car exhaust and dust. On days when air pollution is high, close the windows and stay inside if you can.\\n\\nEat well : Your diet affects COPD in several ways. Food gives you fuel to breathe. Moving air in and out of your lungs takes more work and burns more calories when you have COPD.  Your weight also affects COPD. Being overweight makes it harder to breathe. But if you are too thin, your body will have a hard time fighting illnesses.  Tips for eating well with COPD include:  - Eat small meals and snacks that give you energy, but don't leave you feeling stuffed. Large meals may make it harder for you to breathe.  - Drink water or other liquids throughout the day. Six to eight cups a day is a good goal. Drinking plenty of fluids helps thin mucus so its easier to get rid of it.  - Eat healthy proteins like low-fat milk and cheese, eggs, meat, fish, and nuts.  - Eat healthy fats like olive or canola oils and soft margarine. Ask your doctor how much fat you should eat a day.  - Limit sugary snacks like cakes, cookies, and soda.  - If needed, limit foods like beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks if they make you feel gassy.    If you need to lose weight:  - Lose weight gradually.  - Replace 3 large meals a day with several smaller meals. That way you wont get too hungry.  - Talk with your doctor about an exercise plan that will help you burn calories.    If you need to gain weight, look for ways to add calories to your meals:  - Add a teaspoon of butter or olive oil to vegetables and soups.  - Stock your kitchen with high-energy snacks like walnuts, almonds, and string cheese.  - Add peanut butter or mayonnaise to your sandwiches.  - Drink milkshakes with high-fat ice cream. Add protein powder for an added boost of calories.\\n\\nExercise : Exercise is good for everyone, including people with COPD. Being active can build your strength so you can breathe easier. It can also help you stay healthier for longer.  Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercise is right for you. Then start slow. You may only be able to walk a short distance at first. Over time, you should be able to go longer.  Try to exercise for at least 15 minutes, 3 times a week.  If you become winded, slow down and rest.  Stop exercising and call your doctor if you feel:  - Pain in your chest, neck, arm or jaw  - Sick to your stomach  - Dizzy or lightheaded\\n\\nSleep : A good nights sleep can make you feel better and keep you healthier. But when you have COPD, certain things make it harder to get enough rest:  - You might wake up short of breath or coughing.  - Some COPD medicines make it hard to sleep.  - You might have to take a dose of medicine in the middle of the night.    Here are some safe ways to sleep better:  - Let your doctor know you are having trouble sleeping. A change in your treatment might help you sleep.  - Go to bed at the same time every night.  - Do something to relax before you go to bed. You might take a bath or read a book.  - Use window shades to block outside light.  - Ask your family to help keep the house quiet when its time for you to sleep.  - Don't use over-the-counter sleep aids.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Time out\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002207.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : \"Time out\" is a technique some parents and teachers use when a child misbehaves. It involves the child leaving the environment and activities where the inappropriate behavior occurred, and going to a specific place for a set amount of time. During time out, the child is expected to be quiet and think about their behavior.  Time out is an effective disciplinary technique that does not use physical punishment. Professionals report that NOT physically punishing children may help them learn that physical violence or inflicting physical pain does NOT bring desired results.  Children learn to avoid time out by stopping the behaviors that have caused time outs, or warnings of time outs, in the past.\\n\\nInformation : HOW TO USE TIME OUT  - Find a place in your home that will be suitable for time out. A chair in the hallway or a corner will work. It should be a place that is not too closed-off, dark, or scary. It should also be a place that has no potential for fun, such as in front of a TV or in a play area.  - Get a timer that makes a loud noise, and establish the amount of time to be spent in time out. It is generally recommended to do 1 minute per year of age, but no more than 5 minutes.  - Once your child shows bad behavior, explain clearly what the unacceptable behavior is, and tell your child to stop it. Warn them what will happen if they don\\'t stop the behavior -- sitting in the chair for a time out. Be ready with praise if your child stops the behavior.  - If the behavior does not stop, tell your child to go to time out. Tell them why -- make sure they understand the rules. Only say it once, and do not lose your temper. By yelling and nagging, you are giving your child (and the behavior) too much attention. You may guide your child to the time out spot with as much physical force as necessary (even picking your child up and placing them in the chair). Never spank or physically hurt your child. If your child will not stay in the chair, hold them from behind. Do not speak, as this is giving them attention.  - Set the timer. If your child makes noise or misbehaves, reset the timer. If they get off the time-out chair, lead them back to the chair and reset the timer. The child must be quiet and well-behaved until the timer goes off.  - After the timer rings, your child may get up and resume activities. Do not hold a grudge -- let the issue go. Since your child has done the time out, there is no need to continue to discuss the bad behavior.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: ACADM deficiency; MCAD deficiency; MCADD; MCADH deficiency; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/medium-chain-acyl-coa-dehydrogenase-deficiency\\nAnswer: Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is a condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food (fasting).  Signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). In rare cases, symptoms of this disorder are not recognized early in life, and the condition is not diagnosed until adulthood. People with MCAD deficiency are at risk of serious complications such as seizures, breathing difficulties, liver problems, brain damage, coma, and sudden death.  Problems related to MCAD deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.) \\n',\n",

This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is required to break down (metabolize) a group of fats called medium-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in foods and the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.  Mutations in the ACADM gene lead to a shortage (deficiency) of the MCAD enzyme within cells. Without sufficient amounts of this enzyme, medium-chain fatty acids are not metabolized properly. As a result, these fats are not converted to energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up in tissues and damage the liver and brain. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of MCAD deficiency.) \\n\",\n",

Common causes include\\n                \\n- infections  - functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  - food allergies and intolerances  - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\\n                \\nInfections, food allergies and intolerances, and IBD may cause chronic diarrhea along with malabsorption, meaning the small intestine does not absorb nutrients from food. If children do not absorb enough nutrients from the food they eat, they may become malnourished. Functional GI disorders do not cause malabsorption.\\n                \\nInfections\\n                \\nInfections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites sometimes lead to chronic diarrhea. After an infection, some children have problems digesting carbohydrates, such as lactose, or proteins, such as milk or soy proteins. These problems can cause prolonged diarrheaoften for up to 6 weeksafter an infection. Also, some bacteria and parasite infections that cause diarrhea do not go away quickly without treatment.\\n                \\nMore information about infections that cause diarrhea is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\\n                \\n- Viral Gastroenteritis  - Foodborne Illnesses\\n                \\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also cause chronic diarrhea. Normally, few bacteria live in the small intestine, and many bacteria live in the large intestine. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is an increase in the number of bacteria or a change in the type of bacteria in the small intestine. These bacteria can cause diarrhea, gas, cramping, and weight loss. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often related to diseases or disorders that damage the digestive system or affect how it works, such as Crohns disease or diabetes. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also more common in people who have had abdominal surgery or who have slow-moving intestines.\\n                \\nFunctional Gastrointestinal Disorders\\n                \\nIn functional GI disorders, symptoms are caused by changes in how the GI tract works. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anusthe opening through which stool leaves the body. The GI tract digests, or breaks down, food and processes solid waste.\\n                \\nChildren with a functional GI disorder have frequent symptoms, yet the GI tract does not become damaged. Functional GI disorders are not diseases; they are groups of symptoms that occur together.\\n                \\nTwo functional GI disorders that cause chronic diarrhea in children are toddlers diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\\n                \\nToddlers diarrhea. Toddlers diarrheaalso called functional diarrhea or chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhoodis a common cause of chronic diarrhea in toddlers and preschool-age children. Children with this disorder pass three or more loose stools a day and do not have any other symptoms. They typically are growing well and gaining weight, and are healthy.\\n                \\nToddlers diarrhea develops between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and it usually goes away on its own by the time children begin grade school. Researchers think a diet with too much sugarsuch as the sugar found in fruit juicerelative to the amount of fat and fiber may cause toddlers diarrhea.\\n                \\nIBS. The most common symptoms of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea. The pain or discomfort of IBS typically gets better with the passage of stool or gas. IBS does not cause symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool.\\n                \\nPossible causes include problems with nerves in the intestines, problems with nerve signals between the brain and the intestines, changes in how food moves through the intestines, and hypersensitivity to pain. Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, or food sensitivity may also play a role.\\n                \\nIBS is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in grade school-age children and adolescents.

A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system, the bodys natural defense system, to one or more proteins in certain foods. The immune system normally protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances that can cause illness. In food allergies, however, the immune system responds abnormally to certain foods.\\n                \\nCows milk and soy allergies are the most common food allergies that affect the GI tract in children. Food allergies usually appear in the first year of life. Many children outgrow cows milk and soy allergies by age 3. Allergies to other foods, such as cereal grains, eggs, or seafood, may also affect the GI tract.\\n                \\nSymptoms of food allergies may include diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss or poor weight gain. Some children have mild symptoms, while others have severe or life-threatening symptoms. For example, some children have severe vomiting and diarrhea that lead to dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytesminerals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chlorideto function properly.\\n                \\nCeliac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which people cannot tolerate gluten. A chronic reaction to gluten damages the lining of their small intestine and prevents absorption of nutrients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley and in vitamin and nutrient supplements, lip balms, communion wafers, and certain medications.\\n                \\nChildren of any age can experience digestive symptoms of celiac disease or have symptoms in other parts of the body.

Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming milk or milk products. Lactose is a sugar found in milk or milk products. Lactase, an enzyme produced by the small intestine, breaks down lactose into two simpler forms of sugar: glucose and galactose. The bloodstream then absorbs these simpler sugars.\\n                \\nSome children have a lactase deficiency, meaning the small intestine produces low levels of lactase and cannot digest much lactose. Lactase deficiency may cause lactose malabsorption. In children with lactose malabsorption, undigested lactose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the lactose and create fluid and gas.\\n                \\nNot all children with lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption have digestive symptoms. Experts use the term lactose intolerance when lactase deficiency and lactose malabsorption cause digestive symptoms.\\n                \\nThe most common type of lactase deficiency develops over time, beginning after about age 2, when the body begins to produce less lactase. Children who have lactase deficiency may not experience symptoms of lactose intolerance until late adolescence or adulthood.\\n                \\nInfants rarely have lactose intolerance at birth. People sometimes mistake cows milk allergy, which can cause diarrhea in infants, for lactose intolerance. Congenital lactase deficiencyan extremely rare inherited genetic disorder in which the small intestine produces little or no lactase enzyme at birthcan cause lactose intolerance in infants. Premature infants may experience lactose intolerance for a short time after birth. Children of any age may develop temporary lactose intolerance after a viral diarrheal episode or other infection.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topics:\\n                \\n- Lactose Intolerance  - What I need to know about Lactose Intolerance\\n                \\nDietary fructose intolerance. Dietary fructose intolerance is a condition in which people have digestive symptomssuch as bloating, gas, and diarrheaafter consuming foods that contain fructose. Fructose is a sugar found in fruits, fruit juices, and honey. Fructose is also added to many foods and soft drinks as a sweetener called high fructose corn syrup.\\n                \\nFructose malabsorption causes dietary fructose intolerance. The small intestine absorbs fructose, and, when a person consumes more fructose than the small intestine can absorb, fructose malabsorption results. Unabsorbed fructose passes to the colon, where bacteria break down the fructose and create fluid and gas.\\n                \\nThe amount of fructose that a childs small intestine can absorb varies. The capacity of the small intestine to absorb fructose increases with age. Some children may be able to tolerate more fructose as they get older.\\n                \\nAnother type of fructose intolerance, hereditary fructose intolerance, is not related to fructose malabsorption. Hereditary fructose intolerance is an extremely rare inherited genetic disorder. Children with this disorder lack an enzyme needed to break down fructose. Symptoms of hereditary fructose intolerance may include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. This disorder can also damage the liver and kidneys.\\n                \\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\\n                \\nInflammatory bowel disease causes irritation and inflammation in the intestines. The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease. These disorders can affect children at any age; however, they commonly begin in the grade school years or in adolescence. The causes of IBD are unknown. Researchers believe they result from an abnormal immune system reaction.\\n                \\nUlcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a disease that causes inflammation, or swelling, and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine. The large intestine includes the colon and the rectumthe lower end of the large intestine leading to the anus. Normally, the large intestine absorbs water from stool and changes it from a liquid to a solid. In ulcerative colitis, the inflammation causes loss of the lining of the large intestine, leading to bleeding, production of pus, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.\\n                \\nMore information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Ulcerative Colitis.\\n                \\nCrohns disease.

       " 'Question: What causes Chronic Diarrhea in Children ?\\nURL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx\\nAnswer: To determine the cause of chronic diarrhea in children, the health care provider will take a complete medical and family history and conduct a physical exam, and may perform tests.\\n                \\nMedical and family history. Taking a medical and family history is one of the first things a health care provider may do to help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. He or she will ask for information about symptoms, such as\\n                \\n- how long the child has had diarrhea  - the amount of stool passed  - the frequency of diarrhea  - the appearance of the stool  - the presence of other symptoms that accompany diarrhea\\n                \\nThe health care provider will ask about the childs diet and may recommend keeping a diary of the childs diet and bowel habits. If the health care provider suspects a food allergy or intolerance, he or she may recommend changing the childs diet to see if symptoms improve.\\n                \\nThe health care provider may also ask about family medical history. Some of the conditions that cause chronic diarrhea, such as celiac disease and lactose intolerance, run in families.\\n                \\nPhysical exam. After taking a medical history, a health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may help determine the cause of chronic diarrhea. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually\\n                \\n- examines a childs body  - uses a stethoscope to listen to bodily sounds  - taps on specific areas of the childs body\\n                \\nTests. The health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\\n                \\n- Stool test. A stool test is the analysis of a sample of stool. The health care provider will give the parent or caretaker a container for catching and storing the stool. The parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider or a commercial facility that will send the sample to a lab for analysis. Stool tests can show the presence of blood, bacteria, or parasites or signs of diseases and disorders. The health care provider may also do a rectal exam, sometimes during the physical exam. For a rectal exam, the health care provider inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to check for blood in the stool.    - Blood test. A blood test involves drawing blood at a health care providers office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test can show signs of certain diseases and disorders that can cause chronic diarrhea in children, including      - high levels of white blood cells, which may be a sign of inflammation or infection somewhere in the body    - anemia, which may be a sign of bleeding in the GI tract or of malabsorption    - the presence of certain antibodiesproteins that react against the bodys own cells or tissueswhich may be a sign of celiac disease      - Hydrogen breath test. This test measures the amount of hydrogen in a childs breath. Normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath. However, bacteria break down sugarssuch as lactose and fructosethat are not digested by the small intestine and produce high levels of hydrogen. In small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bacteria break down sugars in the small intestine and produce hydrogen.  For this test, the child breathes into a balloonlike container that measures hydrogen. Then, the child drinks a lactose-loaded beverage, and the childs breath is analyzed at regular intervals to measure the amount of hydrogen. In most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. A health care provider may use a hydrogen breath test to check for signs of lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Upper GI endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the test at a hospital or an outpatient center. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A child may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. A health care provider will place an intravenous (IV) needle in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given.  The health care provider may use instruments passed through the endoscope to perform a biopsy or collect fluid. A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of tissue for examination with a microscope. A pathologista doctor who specializes in diagnosing diseasesexamines the tissues in a lab. This test can show problems in the upper GI tract that may cause chronic diarrhea. For example, a biopsy of the small intestine can show signs of celiac disease. A health care provider may use a fluid sample from the small intestine to check for bacteria to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. While these tests are similar, a health care provider uses a colonoscopy to view the rectum and entire colon and a flexible sigmoidoscopy to view just the rectum and lower colon. A gastroenterologist performs these tests at a hospital or an outpatient center. For both tests, the health care provider will give written bowel prep instructions for the child to follow at home. The health care provider may ask that the child follow a clear liquid diet the day before either test. The child may require a laxative for 4 days before either test or only the day before either test. The child may require an enema the day before either test. These medications cause diarrhea, so the child should stay close to a bathroom during the bowel prep.  In most cases, light anesthesia, and possibly pain medication, helps the child relax. For either test, the child will lie on a table while the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the anus. A small camera on the tube sends a video image of the intestinal lining to a computer screen. The gastroenterologist may also perform a biopsy by taking a small piece of tissue from the intestinal lining. The child will not feel the biopsy. These tests can show problems in the rectum or colon, such as signs of IBD.  Cramping or bloating may occur during the first hour after these tests. The child should recover fully by the next day and be able to return to a normal diet.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: What are the treatments for Chronic Diarrhea in Children ?\\nURL: http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/diarrhea/Pages/diarrhea-in-children-facts.aspx\\nAnswer: The treatment for chronic diarrhea will depend on the cause. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea are treated as follows:\\n                \\n- Infections. If a child has prolonged problems digesting certain carbohydrates or proteins after an acute infection, a health care provider may recommend changes in diet. A child may need antibiotics or medications that target parasites to treat infections that do not go away on their own. A health care provider may also prescribe antibiotics to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.    - Functional GI disorders. For toddlers diarrhea, treatment is usually not needed. Most children outgrow toddlers diarrhea by the time they start school. In many children, limiting fruit juice intake and increasing the amount of fiber and fat in the diet may improve symptoms of toddlers diarrhea.  A health care provider may treat IBS with      - changes in diet.    - medication.    - probioticslive microorganisms, usually bacteria, that are similar to microorganisms normally found in the GI tract. Studies have found that probiotics, specifically Bifidobacteria and certain probiotic combinations, improve symptoms of IBS when taken in large enough amounts. However, researchers are still studying the use of probiotics to treat IBS.    - psychological therapy.\\n                \\nTo help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of complementary and alternative medical practices, including their use of dietary supplements and probiotics, with their health care provider. Read more at www.nccam.nih.gov/health/probiotics.\\n                \\n\\n                \\n- Food allergies and intolerances. A health care provider will recommend changes in diet to manage symptoms of food allergies and intolerances. To treat food allergies, the childs parent or caretaker should remove the food that triggers the allergy from the childs diet.  For children with celiac disease, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage.  The childs parent or caretaker can manage the symptoms of lactose intolerance with changes in the childs diet and by using products that contain the lactase enzyme. Most children with lactose intolerance can tolerate some amount of lactose in their diet. The amount of change needed in the diet depends on how much lactose a child can consume without symptoms.  For children with dietary fructose intolerance, reducing the amount of fructose in the diet can relieve symptoms.    - IBD. A health care provider may use medications, surgery, and changes in diet to treat IBD.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease\\nAnswer: Autoimmune Addison disease affects the function of the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder because it results from a malfunctioning immune system that attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the production of several hormones is disrupted, which affects many body systems.  The signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease can begin at any time, although they most commonly begin between ages 30 and 50. Common features of this condition include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. In addition, many affected individuals have low blood pressure (hypotension), which can lead to dizziness when standing up quickly; muscle cramps; and a craving for salty foods. A characteristic feature of autoimmune Addison disease is abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction, such as the armpits, elbows, knuckles, and palm creases. The lips and the inside lining of the mouth can also be unusually dark. Because of an imbalance of hormones involved in development of sexual characteristics, women with this condition may lose their underarm and pubic hair.  Other signs and symptoms of autoimmune Addison disease include low levels of sugar (hypoglycemia) and sodium (hyponatremia) and high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) in the blood. Affected individuals may also have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and an increase in the number of white blood cells (lymphocytosis), particularly those known as eosinophils (eosinophilia).  Autoimmune Addison disease can lead to a life-threatening adrenal crisis, characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, back or leg cramps, and severe hypotension leading to shock. The adrenal crisis is often triggered by a stressor, such as surgery, trauma, or infection.  Individuals with autoimmune Addison disease or their family members often have another autoimmune disorder, most commonly autoimmune thyroid disease or type 1 diabetes.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: autoimmune Addison's disease; autoimmune adrenalitis; classic Addison disease; primary Addison disease)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/autoimmune-addison-disease\\nAnswer: The cause of autoimmune Addison disease is complex and not completely understood. A combination of environmental and genetic factors plays a role in the disorder, and changes in multiple genes are thought to affect the risk of developing the condition.  The genes that have been associated with autoimmune Addison disease participate in the body's immune response. The most commonly associated genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Each HLA gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. The most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease is a variant of the HLA-DRB1 gene called HLA-DRB1*04:04. This and other disease-associated HLA gene variants likely contribute to an inappropriate immune response that leads to autoimmune Addison disease, although the mechanism is unknown.  Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein, typically a protein called 21-hydroxylase. This protein plays a key role in producing certain hormones in the adrenal glands. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, muscle cramps, skin hyperpigmentation and other features of autoimmune Addison disease.  Rarely, Addison disease is not caused by an autoimmune reaction. Other causes include infections that damage the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, or tumors in the adrenal glands. Addison disease can also be one of several features of other genetic conditions, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, type 1, which are caused by mutations in other genes.) \\n\",\n",

But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.    No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.    There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.    The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear.

It can also be caused byinfection or exposure to toxins. In many cases, the cause is unknown.  The most common form of uveitis is anterior uveitis. This involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it usually only affects the iris, the colored part of the eye. The inflammation may be linked with autoimmune diseases, but most cases occur in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.  Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the uvea. It involves primarily the choroid, which is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle part of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. You may develop this condition if you have had a body-wide (systemic) infection or if you have an autoimmune disease.  Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. This inflammation affects the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn's disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.  Uveitis can be associated with any of the following:  - AIDS  - Ankylosing spondylitis  - Behcet syndrome  - CMV retinitis  - Herpes zoster infection  - Histoplasmosis  - Injury  - Kawasaki disease  - Psoriasis  - Reactive arthritis  - Rheumatoid arthritis  - Sarcoidosis  - Syphilis  - Toxoplasmosis  - Tuberculosis  - Ulcerative colitis) \\n\",\n",

There may be a burning sensation when the blood vessels are sealed to stop bleeding (cauterized).  After the cystoscope is removed, your urethra may be sore. You may feel a burning sensation during urination for a day or two.  If the biopsy needs to be taken from a large area, you may need general or spinal anesthesia before the procedure.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : This test is most often done to check for cancer of the bladder or urethra.\\n\\nNormal Results : The bladder wall is smooth. The bladder is of a normal size, shape, and position. There are no blockages, growths, or stones.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : The presence of cancer cells indicates bladder cancer. The type of cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample.  Other abnormalities may include:  - Bladder diverticula  - Cysts  - Infection  - Ulcers\\n\\nRisks : There is some risk of urinary tract infection.  There is a slight risk of excessive bleeding or rupturing of the bladder wall with the cystoscope or during biopsy.  There is also a risk that the biopsy will fail to diagnose a serious condition.\\n\\nConsiderations : You will likely have a small amount of blood in your urine shortly after this procedure. If the bleeding continues after you urinate, contact your health care provider.  Also contact your health care provider if:  - You have pain, chills, or a fever.  - You are producing less urine than usual (oliguria).  - You cannot urinate despite a strong urge to do so.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Bladder birth defect repair; Everted bladder repair; Exposed bladder repair; Repair of bladder exstrophy)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002997.htm\\nAnswer: Bladder exstrophy repair involves two surgeries. The first surgery is to repair the bladder and the second one is to attach the pelvic bones to each other.  The first surgery separates the exposed bladder from the abdomen wall and closes the bladder. The bladder neck and urethra are repaired. A flexible, hollow tube called a catheter is placed to drain urine from the bladder through the abdominal wall. A second catheter is left in the urethra to promote healing.  The second surgery, pelvic bone surgery, may be done along with the bladder repair, or it may be delayed for weeks or months.  A third surgery may be needed if there is a bowel defect.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: What is (are) Transplant services ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007457.htm\\nAnswer: Transplant surgery is typically done to replace a diseased body part with a healthy one.  SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTS  - Auto islet cell transplant is done after a person has their pancreas removed due to chronic pancreatitis. The procedure takes insulin-producing cells from the pancreas and returns them to the patient's body.  - Corneal transplant replaces a damaged or diseased cornea. The cornea is the clear tissue on the front of the eye that helps focus light on the retina. It is the part of the eye on which a contact lens rests.  - Heart transplant is an option for someone with congestive heart failure that has not responded to medical treatment.  - Intestinal transplant is an option for patients with short bowel or short gut syndrome or advanced liver disease, or who must receive all nutrients through a feeding line. See: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)  - Kidney transplant is an option for someone with chronic kidney failure. It may be donewith a kidney-pancreas transplant.  - Liver transplant may be the only option for someone with liver disease that has led to liver failure.  - Lung transplant may replace one or both lungs. It may be the only option for someone with lung disease who has not gotten better using other medicines and therapies, and is expected to survive for less than 2 years.    BLOOD/BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS (STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS)  You may need a stem cell transplant if you have a disease that damages the cells in bone marrow, or if you received high doses of chemotherapy or radiation.  Depending on the type of transplant, your procedure may be called a bone marrow transplant, a cord blood transplant, or a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. All three use stem cells, which are immature cells that give rise to all blood cells. Stem cell transplants are similar to blood transfusions and generally do not need surgery.  There are two different types of transplants:  - Autologous transplants use your own blood cells or bone marrow.  - Allogeneic transplants use a donor's blood cells or bone marrow. A syngeneic allogenic transplant uses cells or bone marrow from the patient's identical twin.    For more information, see: Bone marrow transplant  THE TRANSPLANT SERVICES TEAM  The transplant services team includes carefully selected experts, including:  - Surgeons who specialize in performing organ transplants  - Medical doctors  - Radiologists and medical imaging technologists  - Nurses  - Infectious disease experts  - Physical therapists  - Psychiatrists, psychologists, and other counselors  - Social workers  - Nutritionists and dietitians    BEFORE A TRANSPLANT  You will have a complete medical exam to identify and treat all medical problems, such as kidney and heart disease.  The transplant team will evaluate you and review your medical history to determine if you meet the criteria for organ transplantation. Most types of organ transplants have guidelines detailing what type of patient is most likely to benefit from a transplant and will be able to manage the challenging process.  If the transplant team believes you are a good candidate for a transplant, you will be put on a national waiting list. Your place on a waiting list is based on a number of factors, which depend on the type of transplant you are receiving.   Once you are on the waiting list, the search for a matching donor begins. Types of donors depend on your specific transplant, but include:  - A living related donor is related to you, such as a parent, sibling, or child.  - A living unrelated donor is a person, such as a friend or spouse.  - A deceased donor is someone who has recently died. The heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, and pancreas can be recovered from an organ donor.    After donating an organ, living donors can live a normal, healthy life.   You should identify family, friends, or other caregivers who can offer help and support during and after the transplant process.  You will also want to prepare your home to make it comfortable for when you return after being released from the hospital.  AFTER A TRANSPLANT  How long you stay in the hospital depends on the type of transplant that you have. During your time in the hospital, you will be seen daily by the transplant services team.  Your transplant services coordinators will arrange for your discharge. They will discuss with you plans for care at home, transportation to clinic visits, and housing, if needed.  You will be told how to take care of yourself after the transplant. This will include information about:  - Medications  - How often you need to visit the doctor or clinic  - What daily activities are allowed or off-limits    After leaving the hospital, you will return home.  You will have periodic follow-ups with the transplant team, as well as with your primary care doctor and any other specialists that may be recommended. The transplant services team will be available to answer any questions that you may have.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003142.htm\\nAnswer: Urinary (or bladder) incontinence happens when you are not able to keep urine from leaking out of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine.  The three main types of urinary incontinence are:  - Stress incontinence -- occurs during activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise.  - Urge incontinence -- involves a strong, sudden need to urinate. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the need to urinate to get to the bathroom before you do urinate.  - Overflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder cannot empty. This leads to dribbling.    Mixed incontinence occurs when you have more than one type of urinary incontinence.  Bowel incontinence is when you are unable to control the passage of stool. It is not covered in this article.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Loss of bladder control; Uncontrollable urination; Urination - uncontrollable; Incontinence - urinary)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003142.htm\\nAnswer: If you have symptoms of incontinence, see your health care provider for tests and a treatment plan. Which treatment you get depends on what caused your incontinence and what type you have.  There are four main treatment approaches for urinary incontinence:  Lifestyle changes. These changes may help improve incontinence. You may need to make these changes along with other treatments.  - Keep your bowel movements regular to avoid constipation. Try increasing the fiber in your diet.  - Quit smoking to reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer.  - Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, which can stimulate your bladder.  - Lose weight if you need to.  - Avoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus fruits and juices.  - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control.    For urine leaks, wear absorbent pads or undergarments. There are many well-designed products no one else will notice.  Bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Bladder retraining helps you gain better control over your bladder. Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Your provider can show you how to do them. Many women do not do these exercises correctly, even if they believe they are doing them correctly. Often, people benefit from formal bladder strengthening and retraining with a pelvic floor specialist.  Medicines. Depending on the type of incontinence you have, your health care provider may prescribe one or more medicines. These drugs help prevent muscle spasms, relax the bladder, and improve bladder function. Your provider can help you learn how to take these medicines and manage their side effects.  Surgery. If other treatments do not work, or you have severe incontinence, your provider may recommend surgery. The type of surgery you have will depend on:  - The type of incontinence you have (such as urge, stress, or overflow)  - How severe your symptoms are  - The cause (such as pelvic prolapse, enlarged prostate, enlarged uterus, or other causes)    If you have overflow incontinence or you cannot fully empty your bladder, you may need to use a catheter. You may use a catheter that stays in long term, or one that you are taught to put in and take out yourself.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer\\nAnswer: Bladder cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the bladder become abnormal and multiply without control or order. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ in the lower abdomen that stores urine until it is ready to be excreted from the body. The most common type of bladder cancer begins in cells lining the inside of the bladder and is called transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).  Bladder cancer may cause blood in the urine, pain during urination, frequent urination, or the feeling that one needs to urinate without results. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, however. They also can be caused by noncancerous conditions such as infections.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: What are the genetic changes related to bladder cancer ? (Also called: Cancer of the bladder; Malignant tumor of urinary bladder; Urinary bladder cancer)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/bladder-cancer\\nAnswer: As with most cancers, the exact causes of bladder cancer are not known; however, many risk factors are associated with this disease. Many of the major risk factors are environmental, such as smoking and exposure to certain industrial chemicals. Studies suggest that chronic bladder inflammation, a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis, and some medications used to treat cancer are other environmental risk factors associated with bladder cancer.  Genetic factors are also likely to play an important role in determining bladder cancer risk. Researchers have studied the effects of mutations in several genes, including FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, and TSC1, on the formation and growth of bladder tumors. Each of these genes plays a critical role in regulating cell division by preventing cells from dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Alterations in these genes may help explain why some bladder cancers grow and spread more rapidly than others.  Deletions of part or all of chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors. Researchers believe that several genes that control cell growth and division are probably located on chromosome 9. They are working to determine whether a loss of these genes plays a role in the development and progression of bladder cancer.  Most of the genetic changes associated with bladder cancer develop in bladder tissue during a person's lifetime, rather than being inherited from a parent. Some people, however, appear to inherit a reduced ability to break down certain chemicals, which makes them more sensitive to the cancer-causing effects of tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals.) \\n\",\n",

The waste is called urea. Your blood carries it to the kidneys. From the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. The bladder stores urine until you are ready to urinate. It swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller when empty. If your urinary system is healthy, your bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (2 cups) of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours.    You may have problems with urination if you have       - Kidney failure    - Urinary tract infections     - An enlarged prostate    - Bladder control problems like incontinence, overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis    - A blockage that prevents you from emptying your bladder        Some conditions may also cause you to have blood or protein in your urine. If you have a urinary problem, see your healthcare provider. Urinalysis and other urine tests can help to diagnose the problem. Treatment depends on the cause.

In reality, it isn\\'t always easy to know when you\\'re going into labor. The steps leading up to labor can drag on for days.  Keep in mind that your due date is just a general idea of when your labor may start. Normal term labor can start any time between 3 weeks before and 2 weeks after this date.\\n\\nFalse labor (Braxton Hicks contractions) : Most pregnant women feel mild contractions before true labor begins. These are called Braxton Hicks contractions, which:  - Are typically short  - Are not painful  - Do not come at regular intervals  - Are not accompanied by bleeding, leaking fluid, or decreased fetal movement    This stage is called \"prodromal\" or \"latent\" labor.\\n\\nOther signs that labor is near : Lightening: This happens when your baby\\'s head \"drops\" down into your pelvis.   - Your belly will look lower. It will be easier for you to breathe because the baby is not putting pressure on your lungs.  - You may need to urinate more often because the baby is pressing on your bladder.  - For first-time mothers, lightening often happens a few weeks before birth. For women who have had babies before, it may not happen until labor has begun.    Bloody show: If you have bloody or brownish discharge from your vagina, it may mean your cervix has begun to dilate. The mucous plug that sealed your cervix for the last 9 months may be visible. This is a good sign. But active labor may still be days away.   Your baby moves less: If you feel less movement, call your doctor or midwife, as sometimes decreased movement can mean that the baby is in trouble.   Your water breaks: When the amniotic sac (bag of fluid around the baby) breaks, you will feel fluid leak from your vagina. It may come out in a trickle or a gush.   - For most women, contractions come within 24 hours after the bag of water breaks.  - Even if contractions don\\'t begin, let your doctor or midwife know as soon as you think your water has broken.

Puberty is often late in these children.  These children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be ruled out.  Genetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for his or her age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents.

It is commonly called a \"sed rate.\"  It is a test that indirectly measures how much inflammation is in the body.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab.  The test measures how fast red blood cells (called erythrocytes) fall to the bottom of a tall, thin tube.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : There are no special steps needed to prepare for this test.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : Reasons why a \"sed rate\" may be done include:  - Unexplained fevers  - Certain types of arthritis  - Muscle symptoms  - Other vague symptoms that cannot be explained   This test may also be used to monitor whether an illness is responding to treatment.   This test can be used to monitor inflammatory diseases or cancer. It is not used to diagnose a specific disorder.  However, the test is useful for detecting and monitoring:  - Autoimmune disorders  - Bone infections  - Certain forms of arthritis  - Inflammatory diseases that cause vague symptoms  - Tissue death\\n\\nNormal Results : For adults (Westergren method):  - Men under 50 years old: less than 15 mm/hr  - Men over 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr  - Women under 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr  - Women over 50 years old: less than 30 mm/hr    For children (Westergren method):  - Newborn: 0 to 2 mm/hr  - Newborn to puberty: 3 to 13 mm/hr    Note: mm/hr = millimeters per hour  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : An abnormal ESR may help with a diagnosis, but it does not prove that you have a certain condition. Other tests are almost always needed.  An increased ESR rate may be due to:  - Anemia  - Cancers such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma  - Kidney disease  - Pregnancy  - Thyroid disease    The immune system helps protect the body against harmful substances. An autoimmune disorder is when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. ESR is often higher than normal in people with an autoimmune disorder.  Common autoimmune disorders include:  - Lupus  - Rheumatoid arthritis in adults or children   Very high ESR levels occur with less common autoimmune disorders, including:  - Allergic vasculitis  - Giant cell arteritis  - Hyperfibrinogenemia (increased fibrinogen levels in the blood)  - Macroglobulinemia - primary  - Necrotizing vasculitis  - Polymyalgia rheumatica   An increased ESR rate may be due to some infections, including:  - Body-wide (systemic) infection  - Bone infections  - Infection of the heart or heart valves  - Rheumatic fever  - Severe skin infections, such as erysipelas  - Tuberculosis   Lower-than-normal levels occur with:  - Congestive heart failure  - Hyperviscosity  - Hypofibrinogenemia (decreased fibrinogen levels)  - Leukemia  - Low plasma protein (due to liver or kidney disease)  - Polycythemia  - Sickle cell anemia) \\n',\n",

They are more likely to be caused by a bone (orthopedic) or nerve (neurological) condition.  Unlike flat feet, highly arched feet tend to be painful because more stress is placed on the section of the foot between the ankle and toes (metatarsals). This condition can make it difficult to fit into shoes. People who have high arches most often need foot support. A high arch may cause disability.) \\n',\n",

A test can be done to measure the amount of this protein in your blood.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : Blood is drawn from a vein. Most of the time, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.  Next, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.  Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.  In infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : Your provider may tell you to stop taking some medicines that could interfere with the test. Drugs that may affect results include:  - Acetaminophen (Tylenol)  - Halothane  - Isoniazid  - Methyldopa  - Nitrofurantoin\\n\\nHow the Test Will Feel : You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : Your doctor may order this test if you have signs of a liver problem. It is used mostly to tell if the high protein level is due to liver damage or skeletal muscle damage.\\n\\nNormal Results : The normal value is 2 to 17 units per liter.  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Greater than normal levels may indicate:  - Cholestasis (when bile, which is made by the liver to help digest fats, is blocked from flowing out of the liver  - Destruction of liver cells  - Hepatitis (liver inflammation)  - Liver ischemia (loss of blood and oxygen to the liver)  - Liver tumor  - Use of a liver-damaging drug\\n\\nRisks : Slight from having blood drawn may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)  - Bruising) \\n\",\n",

It also is used to prevent angina (chest pain) and improve survival after a heart attack. Atenolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure.  High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.) \\n',\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Aging changes in the heart and blood vessels (Also called: Heart disease - aging; Atherosclerosis - aging)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/004006.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age, but many other changes that are common with aging are due to modifiable factors that, if not treated, can lead to heart disease.  BACKGROUND  The heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.  Blood flows out of the heart through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.  Capillaries are where the blood gives up oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.      Watch this video about:   Blood flow     AGING CHANGES  Heart:  - The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate.  - A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle, is not uncommon. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.  - Heart changes cause the ECG of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. They may be caused by heart disease.  - Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the \"aging pigment,\" lipofuscin. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in the elderly.    Blood vessels:  - Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.  - The capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.  - The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most elderly people have a moderate increase in blood pressure.    Blood:  - The blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.  - The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia.  - Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (neutrophils) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection.    EFFECT OF CHANGES  Normally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.  Some of the things that make your heart work harder are:  - Certain medicines  - Emotional stress  - Physical exertion  - Illness  - Infections  - Injuries    COMMON PROBLEMS  - Angina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease.  - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.  - Anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines.  - Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and totally block blood vessels.  - Congestive heart failure is also very common in the elderly. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.  - Coronary artery disease is fairly common. It is often a result of arteriosclerosis.  - High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Elderly people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall.  - Heart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in the elderly.  - Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted.    Other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following:  - Blood clots  - Deep vein thrombosis  - Thrombophlebitis  - Peripheral vascular disease, resulting in intermittent pain in the legs when walking (claudication)  - Varicose veins  - Aneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. Aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. If an aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death.    PREVENTION  - You can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.  - Eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your health care provider\\'s recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking.  - Men between the ages of 65 to 75 who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta.    Get more exercise:  - Exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar.  - Exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress.  - Moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly.  - People who exercise usually have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease.    Have regular check-ups for your heart:  - Have your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.  - If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.  - If you are an older man (between the ages of 65 to 75) and you have a history of smoking, you should be screened for aneurysms in one of the major arteries of the heart.) \\n',\n",

Primary brain tumors may be:  - Not cancerous (benign)  - Invasive (spread to nearby areas)  - Cancerous (malignant)    Brain tumors are classified based on:  - The exact site of the tumor  - The type of tissue involved  - Whether it is cancerous    Brain tumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also indirectly damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.  Tumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.  COMMON TUMOR TYPES  Astrocytomas are usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They commonly develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.  Medulloblastomas are the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.  Ependymomas are a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The location and type of ependymoma determine the type of therapy needed to control the tumor.  Brainstem gliomas are very rare tumors that occur almost only in children.

Exercise has benefits at any age.  Don't worry if you have never exercised, or if you stopped exercising for some reason. Being physically active can help youto keep doingthe things you enjoy and stay independent as you age. The right kind of regular exercise can also reduce yourriskof heart disease, diabetes, and falls.  An effective exercise program needs to be fun and helps to keep you motivated. It helps to have a goal. Your goal might be to:  - Manage a health condition  - Reduce stress  - Improve your stamina  - Be able to buy clothes in a smaller size   Your exercise program mayalso be a way for you to socialize. Taking exercise classes or exercising with a friend are both good ways to be social.  You may have a hard time starting an exercise routine. Once you do start, though, you will begin to notice the benefits, including improved sleep and self-esteem.  Exercise and physical activity can also:  - Improve or maintain your strength and fitness  - Make it easier to do the things you want to do  - Help your balance and walking  - Help with feelings of depression or anxiety and improve your mood  - Maintain your thinking skills (cognitive function) as you get older  - Prevent or treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, breast and colon cancer, and osteoporosis   Always talk to your health care provider before starting an exercise program.Your provider can suggest exercises and activities that are right for you.  Exercises can be grouped into four main categories, although many exercises fit into more than one category:  AEROBIC EXERCISE   Aerobic exercise increases your breathing and heart rate. These exercises help your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. They may prevent or delay many diseases, such as diabetes, colon and breast cancers, and heart disease.  - Aerobic sports activities include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, biking, climbing, tennis, and basketball  - Aerobic activities you can do every day include dancing, yard work, pushing your grandchild on a swing, and vacuuming   MUSCLE STRENGTH  Improving your muscle strength can help you climb stairs, carry groceries, and stay independent. You can build muscle strength by:  - Lifting weights or using a resistance band  - Performing everyday activities, such as carrying a full laundry basket from the basement, carrying your smaller grandchildren, or lifting things in the garden    BALANCE EXERCISES  Balance exercises help prevent falls, which is a concern for older adults. Many exercises that strengthen the muscles in the legs, hips, and lower back will improve your balance. It is often best to learn balance exercises from a physical therapist before starting on your own.  Balance exercises may include:  - Standing on one foot  - Walking heel-to-toe  - Tai chi  - Standing on tiptoe to reach something on the top shelf  - Walking up and down the stairs    STRETCHING  Stretching can help your body stay flexible.

Before birth, your doctor will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This helps determine how well the baby is growing in the womb.   After birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length, head circumference, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair. The baby's developmental gestational age may not be the same as the calendar age. For example, an infant born at 36 weeks may actually have a developmental gestational age of 38 weeks. This baby may be more like a full-term infant than a baby born prematurely.  Determining a babys gestational age is important. It gives your doctor information that help set the babys medical treatment plan.) \\n\",\n",

High blood sugar and high cholesterol levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Simple blood tests can check for these conditions.   There are specific times when you should see your provider. Below are screening guidelines for men ages 40 to 64.  BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING  - Have your blood pressure checked every 2 years. If the top number (systolic number) is between 120 and 139 or the bottom number (diastolic number) is between 80 and 89 mm Hg then have it checked every year.  - Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. Or check your blood pressure using the automated machines at local grocery stores and pharmacies.  - If the top number is greater than 140 or the bottom number is greater than 90, schedule an appointment with your provider.  - If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to have your blood pressure checked more often.     CHOLESTEROL SCREENING AND HEART DISEASE PREVENTION  - If you are age 35 or older, you should be checked every 5 years.  - If you have high cholesterol levels, diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, you may need to be checked more often.  - Some men should consider taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks. Ask your provider before you start aspirin because aspirin may increase your risk for bleeding.    DIABETES SCREENING  - If you are age 45 or older, you should be screened every 3 years.  - If you are overweight, ask your provider if you should be screened at a younger age. Asian Americans should be screened if their BMI is greater than 23.  - If your blood pressure is above 135/80 mm Hg, or you have other risk factors for diabetes, your provider may test your blood sugar level for diabetes.    COLON CANCER SCREENING  If you are under age 50, you should be screened if you have a strong family history of colon cancer or polyps. Screening may also be considered if you have risk factors such as a history of inflammatory bowel disease or polyps.  If you are between ages 50 to 75, you should be screened for colorectal cancer. There are several screening tests available. Some common screening tests include:  - A stool occult blood test done every year  - Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years along with a stool occult blood test every 3 years  - Colonoscopy every 10 years    You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colon cancer, such as:  - Ulcerative colitis  - A personal or family history of colorectal cancer  - A history of colorectal adenomas    DENTAL EXAM  - Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits    EYE EXAM  Have an eye exam every 2 to 4 years ages 40 to 54 and every 1 to 3 years ages 55 to 64. Your provider may recommend more frequent eye exams if you have vision problems or glaucoma risk.  IMMUNIZATIONS  - You should get a flu shot every year.  - Your doctor may recommend other vaccinations if you have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes.  - You should have a tetanus-diphtheria booster vaccination every 10 years. If you have not received a tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines, you should have it once.  - You may get a shingles or herpes zoster vaccination once after age 60.    OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING  - If you are between ages 50 to 70 and have risk factors for osteoporosis, you should discuss screening with your provider.  - Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, having a fracture after age 50, or a family history of osteoporosis.     PHYSICAL EXAM  - Your blood pressure should be checked at least every two years.  - Your height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) should be checked at every exam.    During your exam, your provider may ask you about:  - Depression  - Diet and exercise  - Alcohol and tobacco use  - Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectors    PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING  - Most men age 50 or older should discuss screening for prostate cancer with their provider. African American men and those with a family history of prostate cancer in a first degree relative younger than age 65 should discuss screening at age 45.  - The potential benefits of PSA testing as a routine screening test have not been shown to outweigh the harms of testing and treatment. If you choose to be tested, the PSA blood test is most often done every year.  - Prostate examinations are no longer routinely done on men with no symptoms.     TESTICULAR EXAM  - The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends against performing testicular self-exams. Doing testicular self-exams has been shown to have little to no benefit.

       " 'Question: Do you have information about School-age children development\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002017.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : School-age child development describes the expected physical, emotional, and mental abilities of children ages 6 to 12.\\n\\nInformation : PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  School-age children usually have smooth and strong motor skills. However, their coordination (especially eye-hand), endurance, balance, and physical abilities vary.  Fine motor skills may also vary widely. These skills can affect a child\\'s ability to write neatly, dress appropriately, and perform certain chores, such as making beds or doing dishes.  There will be big differences in height, weight, and build among children of this age range. It is important to remember that genetic background, as well as nutrition and exercise, may affect a child\\'s growth.  A sense of body image begins developing around age 6. Sedentary habits in school-age children are linked to a risk for obesity and heart disease in adults. Children in this age group should get 1 hour of physical activity per day.  There can also be a big difference in the age at which children begin to develop secondary sexual characteristics. For girls, secondary sex characteristics include:  - Breast development  - Underarm and pubic hair growth    For boys, they include:  - Growth of underarm, chest, and pubic hair  - Growth of testicles and penis    SCHOOL  By age 5, most children are ready to start learning in a school setting. The first few years focus on learning the fundamentals.   In 3rd grade, the focus becomes more complex. Reading becomes more about the content than identifying letters and words.   An ability to pay attention is important for success both at school and at home. A 6-year-old should be able to focus on a task for at least 15 minutes. By age 9, a child should be able to focus attention for about an hour.  It is important for the child to learn how to deal with failure or frustration without losing self-esteem. There are many causes of school failure, including:   - Learning disabilities, such a reading disability  - Stressors, such as bullying  - Mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression    If you suspect any of these in your child, talk to your child\\'s teacher or health care provider.  LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  Early school-age children should be able to use simple, but complete, sentences that contain an average of 5 to 7 words. As the child goes through the elementary school years, grammar and pronunciation become normal. Children use more complex sentences as they grow.  Language delays may be due to hearing or intelligence problems. In addition, children who are unable to express themselves well may be more likely to have aggressive behavior or temper tantrums.  A 6-year-old child normally can follow a series of 3 commands in a row. By age 10, most children can follow 5 commands in a row. Children who have a problem in this area may try to cover it up with backtalk or clowning around. They will rarely ask for help because they are afraid of being teased.  BEHAVIOR  Frequent physical complaints (such as sore throats, tummy aches, or arm or leg pain) may simply be due to a child\\'s increased body awareness. Although there is often no physical evidence for such complaints, the complaints should be investigated to rule out possible health conditions. This will also assure the child that the parent is concerned about their well-being.  Peer acceptance becomes more important during the school-age years. Children may take part in certain behaviors to be part of \"the group.\" Talking about these behaviors with your child will allow the child to feel accepted in the group, without crossing the boundaries of the family\\'s behavior standards.  Friendships at this age tend to be mainly with members of the same sex. In fact, younger school-age children often talk about members of the opposite sex as being \"strange\" or \"awful.\" Children become less negative about the opposite sex as they get closer to adolescence.  Lying, cheating, and stealing are all examples of behaviors that school-age children may \"try on\" as they learn how to negotiate the expectations and rules placed on them by family, friends, school, and society. Parents should deal with these behaviors in private with their child (so that the child\\'s friends don\\'t tease them). Parents should show forgiveness, and punish in a way that is related to the behavior.  It is important for the child to learn how to deal with failure or frustration without losing self-esteem.  SAFETY  Safety is important for school-age children.  - School-age children are highly active. They need physical activity and peer approval, and want to try more daring and adventurous behaviors.  - Children should be taught to play sports in appropriate, safe, supervised areas, with proper equipment and rules. Bicycles, skateboards, in-line skates, and other types of recreational sports equipment should fit the child. They should be used only while following traffic and pedestrian rules, and while using safety equipment such as knee, elbow, and wrist pads or braces, and helmets. Sports equipment should not be used at night or in extreme weather conditions.  - Swimming and water safety lessons may help prevent drowning.  - Safety instruction regarding matches, lighters, barbecues, stoves, and open fires can prevent major burns.  - Wearing seat belts is the most important way to prevent major injury or death from a motor vehicle accident.    PARENTING TIPS  - If your child\\'s physical development appears to be outside the norm, talk to your health care provider.  - If language skills appear to be lagging, request a speech and language evaluation.  - Keep close communication with teachers, other school employees, and parents of your child\\'s friends so you are aware of possible problems.  - Encourage children to express themselves openly and talk about concerns without fear of punishment.  - While encouraging children to participate in a variety of social and physical experiences, be careful not to over-schedule free time. Free play or simple, quiet time is important so the child does not always feel pushed to perform.  - Children today are exposed, through the media and their peers, to many issues dealing with violence, sexuality, and substance abuse. Discuss these issues openly with your children to share concerns or correct misconceptions. You may need to set limits to ensure children will be exposed to certain issues only when they are ready.  - Encourage children to participate in constructive activities such as sports, clubs, arts, music, and scouts. Being inactive at this age increases the risk of lifetime obesity. However, it is important not to over-schedule your child. Try to find a balance between family time, school work, free play, and structured activities.  - School-age children should participate in family chores such as setting the table and cleaning up.  - Limit screen time (television and other media) to 2 hours a day.) \\n',\n",

The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Spinocerebellar ataxia 40. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Broad-based gait - Dysarthria - Dysdiadochokinesis - Hyperreflexia - Intention tremor - Pontocerebellar atrophy - Spastic paraparesis - Unsteady gait - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

       " \"Question: What causes Chickenpox ? (Also called: Varicella; Chicken pox)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001592.htm\\nAnswer: Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.  Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:  - From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister  - If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you   Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.  Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.  Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: How to prevent Chickenpox ?

A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.  The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.

       " \"Question: What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007609.htm\\nAnswer: What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. How can I learn more?  - Ask your doctor.  - Contact your local or state health department.  - Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):        - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO)    - Visit CDC's vaccines website) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) Shingles ?\\nURL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html\\nAnswer: Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly, the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages, it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact, one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) What Causes Shingles? Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.  Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases, bacteria can cause more serious conditions, including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin.  - The burning waves of pain, loss of sleep, and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression.  - In patients with immune deficiency, the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious, but they are rarely fatal.  - Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts, avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine  - premature or low birth weight infants  - people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems, such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

       " 'Question: What is (are) Shingles ?\\nURL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shingles/shingles.htm\\nAnswer: Shingles (herpes zoster) is an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox  the varicella-zoster virus. The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. When the varicella-zoster virus reactivates, the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin. The viruses multiply, the tell-tale rash erupts, and the person now has shingles.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Child safety seats (Also called: Child car seats; Infant car seats; Car seats; Car safety seats)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000670.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Child safety seats are proven to save children\\'s lives in accidents.  In the United States, all states require children to be secured in a car seat or booster seat until they are 4\\' 9\" tall. Most children grow to this height when they are between 8 and 12 years old.  To keep your child safe, keep these tips in mind when using a car safety seat.  - When your child is born, you must have a car seat to bring the baby home from the hospital.  - Always secure your child in a car seat whenever riding in a vehicle. Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.  - Read the car seat manufacturer\\'s instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner\\'s manual, too.  - Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.    When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:  - The seat must fit your child\\'s size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.  - It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe. For example, the seat may have been damaged during a car accident.  - Try the seat before buying it. Install the seat in your vehicle. Put your child in the car seat. Secure the harness and buckle. Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.  - DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.  - DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child\\'s safety seat at www.safercar.gov/parents/CarSeats/Car-Seat-Safety.htm.    The types of child safety seats and restraints include:  - Rear-facing seats  - Forward-facing seats  - Booster seats  - Car beds  - Built-in car seats  - Travel vests    REAR-FACING SEATS   A rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle. The seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle. The two types of rear-facing seats are the infant-only seat and the convertible seat.  Infant-only rear-facing seats. These seats are for babies who weigh up to 22 to 30 pounds, depending on the car seat. You will need a new seat when your child gets bigger. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow manufacturer\\'s instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby\\'s head does not shift around while you are driving.  Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 2 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.  FORWARD-FACING SEATS   A forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.  A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat\\'s harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat\\'s instructions), the vehicle\\'s own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in.   BOOSTER SEATS  A booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle\\'s own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child\\'s upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child\\'s shoulder and chest.  Use booster seats for older children until they are 4\\' 9\" tall and between 8 and 12 years old.  CAR BEDS  These seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.  BUILT-IN SEATS  Some vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner\\'s manual or calling the vehicle manufacturer.  TRAVEL VESTS  Special vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats. The vests can be used instead of booster seats. The vests are used with the vehicle\\'s lap and seat belts. As with car seats, children should be sitting in the back seat when using the vest.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm\\nAnswer: There are 2 types of contact dermatitis.  Irritant dermatitis: This is the most common type. It can be by contact with acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. The reaction most often looks like a burn. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to a very irritating substance.  Other materials that may irritate your skin include:  - Cement  - Hair dyes  - Long-term exposure to wet diapers  - Pesticides or weed killers  - Rubber gloves  - Shampoos    Allergic contact dermatitis: This form of the condition occurs when your skin comes in contact with a substance that causes you to have an allergic reaction.   Common allergens include:  - Adhesives, including those used for false eyelashes or toupees  - Antibiotics, such as neomycin rubbed on the surface of the skin  - Balsam of Peru (used in many personal products and cosmetics, as well as in many foods and drinks)  - Fabrics and clothing  - Fragrances in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and moisturizers  - Nail polish, hair dyes, and permanent wave solutions  - Nickel or other metals (found in jewelry, watch straps, metal zips, bra hooks, buttons, pocketknives, lipstick holders, and powder compacts)  - Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other plants  - Rubber or latex gloves or shoes    You will not have a reaction to a substance when you are first exposed to the substance. However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. The reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure.   Some products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity). These include:  - Shaving lotions  - Sunscreens  - Sulfa ointments  - Some perfumes  - Coal tar products  - Oil from the skin of a lime    A few airborne allergens, such as ragweed or insecticide spray, can also cause contact dermatitis.) \\n\",\n",

The same person may also have different symptoms over time.  Allergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months of exposure.   Contact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.  Itching is a common symptom. In the case of an allergic dermatitis, itching can be severe.   You may have red, streaky, or patchy rash where the substance touched the skin. The allergic reaction is often delayed so that the rash may not appear until 24 to 48 hours after exposure.   The rash may:  - Have red bumps that may form moist, weeping blisters  - Feel warm and tender  - Ooze, drain, or crust  - Become scaly, raw, or thickened    Dermatitis caused by an irritant may also cause burning or pain as well as itching.

(Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm\\nAnswer: Your health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.  Allergy testing with skin patches (called patch testing) may determine what is causing the reaction. Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.   - On the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.  - A third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction.  - If you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.    Other tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including skin lesion biopsy or culture of the skin lesion.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Dermatitis - contact; Allergic dermatitis; Dermatitis - allergic; Irritant contact dermatitis; Skin rash - contact dermatitis)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000869.htm\\nAnswer: Your doctor will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.  Often, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin. You should avoid further exposure to the substance.  Emollients or moisturizers help keep the skin moist, and also help skin repair itself. They protect the skin from becoming inflamed again. They are a key part of preventing and treating contact dermatitis.  Topical corticosteroids are medicines used to treat eczema.  - Topical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.  - DO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor advises you to use it.    Your provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.  In severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills. Your provider will start you on a high dose and your dose will be slowly reduced over about 12 days. You may also receive a corticosteroid shot.

It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.\\n\\nCauses : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething\\n\\nHome Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying\\n\\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms.

Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.  - Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.  - You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.  - You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.  - Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits. The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.  - The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons and 2 cups of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and vegetables.    There are several ways you can tell that your baby is ready to eat solid foods:  - Your baby's birth weight has doubled.  - Your baby can control their head and neck movements.  - Your baby can sit up with some support.  - Your baby can show you they are full by turning their head away or by not opening their mouth.  - Your baby begins showing interest in food when others are eating.    You should also know:  - Never give honey to your baby. It may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, a rare but serious illness.  - DO NOT give your baby cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Babies under age 1 have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.  - Never put your child to bed with a bottle. This can cause tooth decay. If your baby wants to suck, give them a pacifier.  - Use a small spoon when feeding your baby.  - It is fine to start to give your baby water between feedings.  - DO NOT give your baby cereal in a bottle unless your pediatrician or dietitian recommends it, for example, for reflux.  - Only offer your child new foods when they are hungry.  - Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 2 to 3 days between. That way you can watch for allergic reactions. Signs of an allergy include diarrhea, rash, or vomiting.  - Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.  - Feed your baby directly from the jar only if you use the entire jar contents. Otherwise, use a dish to prevent food-borne illness.  - Opened containers of baby's food should be covered and stored in a refrigerator for no longer than 2 days.    8 to 12 MONTHS OF AGE  At this age, you can offer finger foods in small amounts. Your baby will probably let you know they are ready to start feeding themselves by grabbing the food or spoon with their hand.  Good finger foods include:  - Soft cooked vegetables  - Washed and peeled fruits  - Graham crackers  - Melba toast  - Noodles    You can also introduce teething foods, such as:  - Toast strips  - Unsalted crackers and bagels  - Teething biscuits    Continue to offer your baby breast milk or formula 3 to 4 times per day at this age.  You should also know:  - Avoid foods that may cause choking, such as apple chunks or slices, grapes, berries, raisins, dry flake cereals, hot dogs, sausages, peanut butter, popcorn, nuts, seeds, round candies, and raw vegetables.  - You can give your child egg yolks 3 to 4 times per week. Some babies are sensitive to egg whites. So DO NOT offer them until after age 1.  - You can offer small amounts of cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, but no cow's milk.  - By age 1, most children are off the bottle. If your child still uses a bottle, it should contain water only.    1 YEARof AGE  - At this age, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.  - Most mothers in the U.S. wean their babies by this age. But it is also fine to continue to nurse if you and your baby want to.  - DO NOT give your child low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) until after age 2. Your baby needs the extra calories from fat to grow and develop.  - At this age, your baby will get most of their nutrition from proteins, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and dairy. You can make sure your baby gets all the vitamins and minerals they need by offering a variety of foods.  - Your child will start to crawl and walk and be much more active. They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.  - At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant.    You should also know:  - If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.  - DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.  - Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.  - If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food.    2 YEARS of AGE  - After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat. A high-fat diet can lead to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems later in life.  - Your child should eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups: breads and grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and dairy.  - If your water is not fluoridated, it is a good idea to use toothpaste or mouthwash with fluoride added.    All children need plenty of calcium to support their growing bones. But not all kids get enough. Good sources of calcium include:  - Low-fat or nonfat milk, yogurt, and cheese  - Cooked greens  - Canned salmon (with bones)    If your child's diet is balanced and healthy, they should not need a vitamin supplement. Some kids are picky eaters, but usually they still get all the nutrients they need. If you are concerned, ask your health care provider whether your child needs a children's multivitamin.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Child's Health Care Provider : Call the provider if you are concerned your child:  - Is not eating enough  - Is eating too much  - Is gaining too much or too little weight  - Has an allergic reaction to food) \\n\",\n",

It also helps remove excess mucus (snot) and adds moisture. Your nasal passages are open spaces behind your nose. Air passes through your nasal passages before entering your lungs.   Nasal washes can help relieve nasal allergy symptoms and help prevent sinus infections (sinusitis).\\n\\nHow to use Saline Nasal Washes : You can buy a device such as a neti pot, squeeze bottle, or rubber nasal bulb at your drug store. You can also buy saline solution made specifically for nasal rinses. Or, you can make your own rinse by mixing:  - 3 teaspoons (tsp) canning or pickling salt (no iodine)  - 1 tsp baking soda  - 1 cup warm distilled, filtered, or boiled water    To use the wash:  - Fill the device with half the saline solution.  - Keeping your head over a sink or in the shower, tilt your head sideways to the left. Breathe through your open mouth.  - Gently pour or squeeze the solution into your right nostril. The water should come out the left nostril.  - You can adjust the tilt of your head to keep the solution from going into your throat or into your ears.  - Repeat on the other side.  - Gently blow your nose to remove remaining water and mucus.\\n\\nImportant Tips : You should:  - Be sure you only use distilled, boiled, or filtered water. While rare, some tap water may contain small germs that can cause infection.  - Always clean the neti pot or nasal bulb with distilled, boiled, or filtered water after every use and let it dry.  - Use the nasal wash before using other medicines, such as a nasal spray. This will help your nasal passages better absorb the medicine.  - It may take a few attempts to learn the technique of washing your nasal passages. You also may feel a slight burn at first, which should go away. If needed, use a little less salt in your saline solution.  - DO NOT use if your nasal passages are completely blocked.\\n\\nWhen to Call the Doctor : Be sure to call your health care provider if you notice:  - Nosebleeds  - Fever  - Pain  - Headaches) \\n',\n",

(Also called: duplication/inversion 15q11; idic(15); inv dup(15); inverted duplication 15; isodicentric chromosome 15; non-distal tetrasomy 15q)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/isodicentric-chromosome-15-syndrome\\nAnswer: Isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome is a developmental disorder with a broad spectrum of features. The signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.  Poor muscle tone is commonly seen in individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome and contributes to delayed development and impairment of motor skills, including sitting and walking.  Babies with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome often have trouble feeding due to weak facial muscles that impair sucking and swallowing; many also have backflow of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux). These feeding problems may make it difficult for them to gain weight.  Intellectual disability in isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome can range from mild to profound. Speech is usually delayed and often remains absent or impaired. Behavioral difficulties often associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome include hyperactivity, anxiety, and frustration leading to tantrums. Other behaviors resemble features of autistic spectrum disorders, such as repeating the words of others (echolalia), difficulty with changes in routine, and problems with social interaction.  About two-thirds of people with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome have seizures. In more than half of affected individuals, the seizures begin in the first year of life.  About 40 percent of individuals with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome are born with eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus). Hearing loss in childhood is common and is usually caused by fluid buildup in the middle ear. This hearing loss is often temporary. However, if left untreated during early childhood, the hearing loss can interfere with language development and worsen the speech problems associated with this disorder.  Other problems associated with isodicentric chromosome 15 syndrome in some affected individuals include minor genital abnormalities in males such as undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis).) \\n',\n",

During this phase, the immune system in someone with HIV slowly deteriorates, but the person has no symptoms. How long this phase lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus.

(Also called: HIV testing; HIV screening; HIV screening test; HIV confirmatory test)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003538.htm\\nAnswer: In general, testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a 2-step process that involves a screening test and follow-up tests.  SCREENING TESTS  These are tests that check if you've been infected with HIV. The most common tests are described below.  An antibody test (also called immunoassay) checks for antibodiesto the HIV virus. Your health care provider may order the test for you to have done at a lab. Or, you may have it done at a testing center or use a home kit. These tests can detect antibodies starting a few weeks after youre infected with the virus. Antibody tests can be done using:  - Blood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick. A blood test is the most accurate because blood has a higher level of antibodies than other body fluids.  - Oral fluid -- This test checks for antibodies in the cells of the mouth. It is done by swabbing the gums and inside cheeks. This test is less accurate than the blood test.  - Urine -- This test checks for antibodies in the urine. This test is also less accurate than the blood test.   An antigen test checks your blood for an HIV antigen, called p24. When you're first infected with HIV, and before your body has a chance to make antibodies to the virus, your blood has a high level of p24. The p24 antigen test is accurate 11 days to 1 month after getting infected. This test is usually not used by itself to screen for HIV infection.  An antibody-antigen blood test checks for levels of both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen. This test can detect the virus as early as 3 weeks after getting infected.  FOLLOW-UP TESTS  A follow-up test is also called a confirmatory test. It is usually done when the screening test is positive. Several kinds of tests may be used to:  - Detect the virus itself  - Detect antibodies more accurately than screening tests  - Tell the difference between the 2 types of virus, HIV-1 and HIV-2) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001944.htm\\nAnswer: Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.  TEEN DRINKING  Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S.  About 1 in 5 teens are considered \"problem drinkers.\" This means that they:  - Get drunk  - Have accidents related to alcohol use  - Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol    THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL  Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them:  - Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more.  - Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol.  - Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol.    Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.  The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.  Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster.Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.  Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your \"blood alcohol level.\" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.  Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:  - 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions  - 0.10 -- slurred speech  - 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment  - 0.30 -- confusion  - 0.40 -- stupor  - 0.50 -- coma  - 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death    You can have symptoms of \"being drunk\" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.  HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL  Alcohol increases the risk of:  - Alcoholism  - Falls, drownings, and other accidents  - Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers  - Motor vehicle accidents  - Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  - Suicide and homicide    Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible.  RESPONSIBLE DRINKING  If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor.  Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:  - Never drink alcohol and drive a car.  - If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus.  - Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.    If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick.  If alcohol use runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether.  CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:  - You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member  - You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use or support groups  - You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking    Other resources include:  - Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups  - Local hospitals  - Public or private mental health agencies  - School or work counselors  - Student or employee health centers) \\n',\n",

Tiny germs can be in water, even when it looks clean. You need to be careful where you get your water from. This includes water for drinking, cooking, and brushing your teeth. Ask your doctor or nurse about special care you should take.\\n\\nTap water : Tap water is water from your faucet. It should be safe when it comes from:  - A city water supply  - A city well that supplies many people with water    If you live in a small city or town, check with your local water department. Ask if they test the water every day for the kind of germs that can give you an infection -- germs are called coliforms.\\n\\nWell water : Boil water from a private well or a small community well before you drink it or use it for cooking or brushing your teeth.  Running well water through a filter or adding chlorine to it does not make it safe to use. Test your well water at least once a year for coliform germs that may cause an infection. Test your water more often if coliforms are found in it or if there is any question about the safety of your water.  To boil water and store it:  - Heat the water to a rolling boil.  - Keep the water boiling for at least 1 minute.  - After boiling the water, store it in the refrigerator in a clean and covered container.  - Use all this water within 3 days (72 hours). If you do not use it in this time, pour it down the drain or use it to water your plants or your garden.\\n\\nBottled water : The label on any bottled water you drink should say how it was cleaned.

It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people between ages 15 and 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.   Parents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.\\n\\nInformation : Make a Commitment to Safety  Teens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.  - Reckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.  - All new drivers should take a driver\\'s education course. These courses can reduce risk for crashes.    Drivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include: seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.  Auto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children. Infants and young children should be properly buckled into a child safety seat of the right size that is correctly installed in the vehicle.  Avoid Distracted Driving   Distractions are a problem for all drivers. Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.   - Mobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.  - If phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.    Other tips include:  - Avoid putting on makeup while driving, even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.  - Finish eating before starting your car and driving.    Driving with friends can lead to accidents.  - Teens are safer driving alone or with family. For the first 6 months, teens should drive with an adult driver who can help them learn good driving habits.  - New drivers should wait at least 3 to 6 months before taking friends as passengers.    Teenage-related driving deaths occur more often in certain conditions.  Other safety tips for teens  - Reckless driving is still a danger, even when using seatbelts. Do not rush. It is safer to be late.  - Avoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.  - When drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.  - Never drink and drive. Drinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive. ALWAYS find someone to drive who has not been drinking -- even if this means making an uncomfortable phone call.  - Drugs can be just as dangerous as alcohol. Do not mix driving with marijuana, other illegal drugs or any prescribedmedicine that makes you sleepy.   Parents should talk with their teens about \"household driving rules.\"  - Make a written \"driving contract\" that both parents and teens sign.  - The contract should include a list of driving rules and what teens can expect if the rules are broken.  - The contract should state that parents have the final say about the driving rules.  - When writing the contract, take into account all of the driving issues that are likely to come up.    Parents can do the following to help prevent teens from drinking and driving:  - Tell their teens to call rather than get in a car with a driver who has been drinking or when they have been drinking. Promise no punishment if they call first.    Some children continue to mix driving and drinking. In many states, the parent must sign for a teenager under 18 to get a driver\\'s license. At any time before the 18th birthday a parent can refuse responsibility and the state will take the license.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Safe eating during cancer treatment\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000061.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : When you have cancer, you need good nutrition to help keep your body strong. To do this you need to watch the foods you eat and how you prepare them.  Some raw foods can contain germs that can hurt you when cancer or treatment weakens your immune system. Ask your doctor or nurse about how to eat well but safely.  When you eat eggs:  - Yolks and whites should be cooked solid. Do not eat runny eggs.  - Do not eat foods that may have raw eggs in them (such as Caesar salad dressing, cookie dough, cake batter, and hollandaise sauce).    Be careful when you have dairy products:  - All milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy should have the word pasteurized on their containers.  - Do not eat soft cheeses or cheeses with blue veins (such as Brie, Camembert, Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and Bleu).  - Do not eat Mexican-style cheeses (such as queso blanco fresco and cojita).    Fruits and vegetables:  - Wash all raw fruits, vegetables, and fresh herbs with cold running water.  - Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts (such as alfalfa and mung bean).  - Do not use fresh salsa or salad dressings that are kept in the refrigerated cases of the grocery store.  - Drink only juice that says pasteurized on the container.    Do not eat raw honey. Eat only heat-treated honey. Avoid sweets that have creamy fillings.\\n\\nCook foods safely : When you cook, make sure you cook your food long enough.  Do not eat uncooked tofu. Cook tofu for at least 5 minutes.  When eating chicken and other poultry:  - Cook whole pieces of poultry to 180 F.  - Cook ground poultry to 165 F.    If you cook beef, lamb, pork, or venison:  - Do not eat raw mean, such as Japanese sashimi.  - Make sure meat is not red or pink before you eat it.  - Cook meat to 160 F.    When eating fish, oysters, and other shellfish:  - Do not eat raw fish (such as sushi), raw oysters, or any other raw shellfish.  - Make sure all fish and shellfish you eat is cooked thoroughly.    Heat all casseroles to 165 F. Warm hot dogs and lunch meats to steaming before you eat them.\\n\\nBe careful when you eat out : When you dine out, stay away from:  - Raw fruits and vegetables  - Salad bars, buffets, sidewalk vendors, potlucks, and delis    Ask if all fruit juices are pasteurized.  Use only salad dressings, sauces, and salsas from single-serving packages. Eat out at times when restaurants are less crowded. Always ask for your food to be prepared fresh, even at fast food restaurants.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Safe sex\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001949.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Safe sex means taking steps before and during sex that can prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving an infection to your partner.\\n\\nInformation : A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:  - Chlamydia  - Genital herpes  - Genital warts  - Gonorrhea  - Hepatitis  - HIV  - HPV  - Syphilis    STIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  These infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.  Before having sex:  - Get to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories  - Don't feel forced into having sex  - Don't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner    Your sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI. Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.  If you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.  Use condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.  - The condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.  - Keep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.    Other tips include:   - Use lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.  - Use only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.  - Polyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.  - Using condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may increase the chance of HIV transmission.  - Stay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.    Get tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Most STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.  Women should consider getting the HPV vaccine to keep from getting the human papillomavirus. This virus can put you at risk for vaginal warts and cervical cancer.) \\n\",\n",

It is done to monitor the heart's function and blood flow. This test is most often done in persons who are very ill.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : The test can be done while you are in bed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital or in special procedure areas such as a cardiac catheterization laboratory.  Before the test starts, you may be given medicine (sedative) to help you relax.  You will lie on a padded table. Your doctor will make a small surgical cut near the groin or in your neck. A flexible tube (catheter or sheath) is placed through the cut into a vein. Sometimes, it will be placed in your arm. You will be awake during the procedure.  A larger catheter is inserted and carefully moved into the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. X-ray images may be used to help the health care provider see where the catheter should be placed.  Blood may be removed from the catheter to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood.  During the procedure, your heart's rhythm will be constantly watched using an electrocardiogram (ECG).\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test starts. You may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in to the hospital the morning of the test.   You will wear a hospital gown. You must sign a consent form before the test. Your health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : You may be given medicine to help you relax before the procedure. You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.  You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm. You may also feel some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted. In people who are critically ill, the catheter may stay in place for several days.  You may feel discomfort when the area of the vein is numbed with anesthetic.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : The procedure is done to evaluate how the blood moves (circulates) in people who have:  - Abnormal pressures in the heart arteries  - Burns  - Congenital heart disease  - Heart failure  - Kidney disease  - Leaky heart valves (valvular regurgitation)  - Shock   It may also be done to monitor for complications of heart attack and to see how well certain heart medicines are working.  Swan-Ganz catheterization can also be used to detect abnormal blood flow between two areas of the heart that are not normally connected.   Conditions that can also be diagnosed or evaluated with Swan-Ganz catheterization include:  - Cardiac tamponade  - Pulmonary hypertension  - Restrictive cardiomyopathy\\n\\nNormal Results : - Cardiac index is 2.8 to 4.2 liters per minute per square meter (of body surface area)  - Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 17 to 32 millimeters of mercury (mmHg)  - Pulmonary artery mean pressure is 9 to 19 mmHg  - Pulmonary diastolic pressure is 4 to 13 mmHg  - Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is 4 to 12 mmHg  - Right atrial pressure is 0 to 7 mmHg\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to:  - Blood flow problems, such as heart failure or shock  - Heart valve disease  - Lung disease  - Structural problems with the heart, such as a septal defect\\n\\nRisks : Risks of the procedure include:  - Bruising around the area where the catheter was inserted  - Injury to the vein  - Puncture to the lung if the neck or chest veins are used, causing lung collapse (pneumothorax)   Very rare complications include:  - Cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment   - Cardiac tamponade  - Embolism caused by blood clots at the tip of the catheter  - Infection  - Low blood pressure) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about Taking multiple medicines safely\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000883.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : If you take more than one medicine, it is important to take them carefully and safely. Some medicines can interact and cause side effects. It can also be hard to keep track of when and how to take each medicine.  Here are tips to help you keep track of your medicines and take them as directed.\\n\\nWhy you may Need More Than one Medicine : You may take more than one medicine to treat a single condition. Or you may take different medicines to treat more than one health problem. For example, you may take a statin to lower your cholesterol, and a beta-blocker to control your blood pressure.   Older adults often have more than one health condition. So they are more likely to take several medicines.\\n\\nRisks of Taking Multiple Medicines : The more medicines you take, the more you need to use them carefully. There are several risks when taking multiple medicines.  - You may be more likely to have side effects. Because most medicines can have side effects, the more medicines you take, the more likely you will have side effects. Taking certain medicines can also increase the risk of falls.  - You are at higher risk for drug interactions. An interaction is when one medicine affects how another medicine works. For example, taken together, one medicine may make the other medicine stronger. Medicines can also interact with alcohol and even some foods. Some interactions can be serious, even life threatening.  - You may find it hard to keep track of when to take each medicine. You even may forget which medicine you have taken at a certain time.  - You may take a medicine you do not need. This may be more likely to happen if you see more than one health care provider. You may be prescribed different medicines for the same problem.\\n\\nPeople at Higher Risk : Certain people are more likely to have problems from taking multiple medicines:  - People who are prescribed 5 or more medicines. The more medicines you take, the higher the chance of interactions or side effects. You may also find it hard to remember all possible drug interactions.  - People who take medicines prescribed by more than one provider. One provider may not know that you are taking medicines another provider has given you.  - Older adults. As you age, your body processes medicines differently. For instance, your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. This can mean that more medicine stays in your body for longer. This can lead to dangerous levels of medicines in your system.  - People in the hospital. When you are in the hospital, you will likely see new providers who are not familiar with your health history. Without this knowledge, they may prescribe a medicine that may interact with medicines you already take.\\n\\nWhat you can do : These suggestions can help you take all of your medicines safely:  - Keep a list of all medicines you take. Your list should include all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. OTC medicines include vitamins, supplements, and herbal products. Keep a copy of the list in your wallet and at home.  - Review your medicine list with your health care providers and pharmacists. Discuss the list with your provider each time you have an appointment. Ask your provider if you still need to take all of the medicines on your list. Also ask if any of the dosages should be changed. Make sure you give all of your providers a copy of your medicine list.  - Ask questions about any new drugs you are prescribed. Make sure you understand how to take them. Also ask if a new medicine could interact with any of the medicines or supplements you are already taking.  - Take your medicines exactly as your provider tells you. If you have questions about how or why to take your medicine, ask your provider. DO NOT skip doses, or stop taking your medicines.  - If you notice side effects, tell your health care provider. DO NOT stop taking your medicines unless your provider tells you to.  - Keep your medicines organized. There are many ways to keep track of your medicines. A pill organizer may help. Try one or more methods and see what works for you.  - If you have a hospital stay, bring your medicine list with you. Talk with your provider about medicine safety while you are in the hospital.\\n\\nWhen to Call the Doctor : Call if you have questions or you are confused about the directions for your medicine. Call if you have any side effects from your medicines. DO NOT stop taking any medicine unless your health care provider tells you to stop.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Do you have information about Using over-the-counter medicines safely\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are drugs you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using OTC the medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.  Here is what you need to know about OTC drugs.\\n\\nAbout OTC Medicines : You can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:  - Drug stores  - Grocery stores  - Discount and department stores  - Convenience stores  - Some gas stations    When used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:  - Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea  - Preventing problems like heartburn or motion sickness  - Treating conditions such as athletes foot, allergies, or migraine headaches  - Providing first aid\\n\\nWhen Should you Use OTC Medicines : It is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:  - Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition  - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take  - What side effects or problems to watch for    Your pharmacist can answer questions such as:  - What the medicine will do  - How it should be stored  - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\\n\\nWhat the Label can Tell you : You can also get information about OTC drugs on the medicine label.  Most OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.  Here is what the label will show you:  - Active Ingredient. This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose.  - Uses. The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, DO NOT use the medicine for any condition not listed.  - Warnings. Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. Some medicines you should not take when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose.  - Directions. The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Fully read the directions, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages.  - Other information. This includes such things as how to store the medicine.  - Inactive ingredients. Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.    The label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\\n\\nOther Ways to Use OTC Medicines Safely : You should:  - Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with.  - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place you bought it.  - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container.  - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.    Also be sure to take steps to keep kids safe. You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight.) \\n\",\n",

Hydrogen peroxide poisoning occurs when large amounts of the liquid are swallowed or get in the lungs or eyes.  This is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\\n\\nPoisonous Ingredient : Hydrogen peroxide can be poisonous if it is not used correctly.\\n\\nWhere Found : Hydrogen peroxide is used in these products:  - Hydrogen peroxide  - Hair bleach  - Some contact lens cleaners   Note: Household hydrogen peroxide has a 3% concentration. That means it contains 97% water and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Hair bleaches are stronger. They usually have a concentration of more than 6%. Some industrial-strength solutions contain more than 10% hydrogen peroxide.\\n\\nSymptoms : Symptoms of a hydrogen peroxide poisoning include:  - Abdominal pain and cramping  - Breathing difficulty (if large concentrations are swallowed)  - Body aches  - Burns in the mouth and throat (if swallowed)  - Chest pain  - Eye burns (if it gets in the eyes)  - Seizures (rare)  - Stomach swelling  - Temporary white color to the skin  - Vomiting (sometimes with blood)\\n\\nHome Care : Seek medical help right away.

       " \"Question: Do you have information about Diaphragmatic hernia repair - congenital\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002936.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Diaphragmatic hernia repair is surgery to correct an opening or space in a baby's diaphragm. This opening is called a hernia. It is a rare type of birth defect. (Congenital means the problem is present at birth.)\\n\\nDescription : Before this surgery, nearly all infants need a breathing device to improve their oxygen levels.  The surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia (asleep and not able to feel pain). The surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the belly under the upper ribs. This allows the organs in the area to be reached. The surgeon gently pulls these organs down into place through the opening in the diaphragm and into the abdominal cavity.  The surgeon repairs the hole in the diaphragm. If the hole is small, it may be repaired with stitches. In most cases, a piece of plastic patch is used to cover the hole.\\n\\nWhy the Procedure is Performed : The diaphragm is a muscle. It is important for breathing. It separates the chest cavity (where the heart and lungs are) from the belly area.   In a child born with a diaphragmatic hernia, the diaphragm muscle is not completely formed. So, organs from the belly (stomach, spleen, liver, and intestines) may go up into the chest cavity where the lungs are. This prevents the lung(s) from growing normally. The lungs stay too small for babies to breathe on their own when they are born.   A diaphragmatic hernia can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair it must be done in the first few days or weeks of a child's life.\\n\\nRisks : Risks for this surgery include:   - Breathing problems, which may be severe  - Bleeding  - Collapsed lung  - Lung problems that do not go away  - Infection  - Reactions to medicines\\n\\nBefore the Procedure : Infants with a diaphragmatic hernia are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). It may be days or weeks before the baby is stable enough for surgery.  - In the NICU, your baby will probably need a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) before the surgery. This helps the baby breathe.  - If your child is very sick, a heart-lung bypass machine (ECMO) may be needed to do the work of the heart and lungs.  - Before surgery, your baby will have x-rays and regular blood tests to see how well the lungs are working. A light sensor (called a pulse oximeter) is taped to baby's skin to monitor the oxygen level in the blood.  - Your baby may be given medicines to control blood pressure and keep him or her comfortable.    Your baby will have tubes placed:  - From the mouth or nose to the stomach to keep air out of the stomach  - In an artery to monitor blood pressure  - In a vein to deliver nutrients and medicines\\n\\nAfter the Procedure : Your baby will be on a breathing machine after the surgery and will stay in the hospital for several weeks. Once the baby is taken off the breathing machine, they may still need oxygen and some medicine for a while.  Feedings will start after your baby's bowels start working. Feedings are usually given through a small, soft feeding tube from the mouth or nose into the stomach or small intestines until your baby can take all the milk they need by mouth.  Most infants with diaphragmatic hernias have reflux when they eat. This means the food or acid in their stomach moves up into their esophagus, the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This can be uncomfortable for your baby. It also leads to frequent spitting up, vomiting, and pneumonia, which makes feedings more difficult once your baby is taking food by mouth.  The nurses and feeding specialists will teach you ways to hold and feed your baby to prevent reflux. Some babies need to be on a feeding tube for a long time to get enough food to grow.\\n\\nOutlook (Prognosis) : The outcome of this surgery depends on how well your baby's lungs have developed. Some babies have other medical problems, including problems with the brain, muscles, and joints, which may slow recovery.   Usually, the outlook is good for infants who have well-developed lung tissue. Most babies who are born with a diaphragmatic hernia are very ill and will stay in the hospital for a long time. With advances in medicine, the outlook for these infants is gradually improving.  All babies who have had diaphragmatic hernia repairs will need to be watched closely to make sure the hole in their diaphragm does not open up again as they grow.  Babies who had a large opening or defect in the diaphragm, or who had more problems with their lungs after birth, may have lung disease after they leave the hospital. They may need oxygen, medicines, and a feeding tube for months or years.  Some babies will have problems crawling, walking, talking, and eating. They will need to see physical or occupational therapists to help them develop muscles and strength.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: What is (are) congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia\\nAnswer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.  In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons.  Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.) \\n',\n",
       " 'Question: What are the genetic changes related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia ? (Also called: congenital diaphragmatic defect)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia\\nAnswer: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.  About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.  Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.  More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Test/procedure preparation - adolescent; Preparing adolescent for test/procedure; Preparing for a medical test or procedure - adolescent)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002054.htm\\nAnswer: There are many ways to help an adolescent prepare for a medical test or procedure.  First, provide detailed information and explain the reasons for the procedure. Let your adolescent take part and make as many decisions as possible.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE  Explain the procedure in correct medical terms. Tell your adolescent why the test is being done. (Ask your health care provider to explain it if you are not sure.) Understanding the need for the procedure may reduce your adolescent's anxiety.  To the best of your ability, describe how the test will feel. Allow your adolescent to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the test, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  Be honest about discomfort your adolescent may feel, but don't dwell on it. It may help to stress the benefits of the test, and to say that the test results may provide more information. Talk about things that your adolescent may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. Rewards such as shopping trips or movies may be helpful if the adolescent is able to do them.  Tell your adolescent as much as you can about the equipment that will be used for the test. If the procedure will take place in a new location, it may help to tour the facility with your adolescent before the test.  Suggest ways for your adolescent to stay calm, such as:  - Blowing bubbles  - Breathing deeply  - Counting  - Creating a quiet, peaceful environment  - Doing relaxation techniques (thinking pleasant thoughts)  - Holding the hand of a calm parent (or someone else) during the procedure  - Playing hand-held video games  - Using guided imagery  - Trying other distractions, such as listening to music through headphones, if allowed    When possible, let your adolescent make some decisions, such as deciding the time of day or the date of the procedure. The more control a person has over a procedure, the less painful and anxiety-producing it is likely to be.  Allow your adolescent to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed.  Discuss possible risks. Adolescents are often concerned about risks, particularly about any effects on their appearance, mental function, and sexuality. Address these fears honestly and openly if at all possible. Provide information about any appearance changes or other possible side effects the test may cause.  Older adolescents may benefit from videos that show adolescents of the same age explaining and through the procedure. Ask your health care provider if such films are available for your adolescent to view. It may also be helpful for your adolescent to discuss any concerns with peers who have managed similar stressful situations. Ask your health care provider if they know any teens who are interested in doing peer counseling, or if they can recommend a local support group.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  If the procedure is done at a hospital or your health care provider's office, ask if you can stay with your adolescent. However, if your adolescent does not want you to be there, honor this wish. Out of respect for your adolescent's growing need for privacy and independence, do not allow peers or siblings to watch the procedure unless adolescent asks them to be there.  Do not show your own anxiety. Looking anxious will make your adolescent more upset and worried. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.  Other considerations:  - Ask your health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure. This can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your adolescent be present during the procedure, if possible.  - Your adolescent may have a hard time with a new authority figure entering the situation. This complication can be reduced if someone he or she knows performs the test. Otherwise, your adolescent may show some resistance. Prepare your adolescent in advance for the possibility that the test will be done by someone he or she doesn't know.  - Ask that anesthesia be used, if appropriate, to reduce any discomfort.  - Assure your adolescent that his or her reactions are normal.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Handling sharps and needles\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000444.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : Sharps are medical devices like needles, scalpels, and other tools that cut or go into the skin. Learning how to safely handle sharps is important to prevent accidental needlesticks and cuts.\\n\\nPreventing Injuries : Before you use a sharp object, such as a needle or scalpel, make sure you have all the items you need close by. This includes items like alcohol swabs, gauze, and bandages.  Also, know where the sharps disposal container is. Check to make sure there is enough room in the container for your object to fit. It should not be more than two-thirds full.  Some needles have a protective device, such as a needle shield, sheath, or blunting, that you activate after you remove the needle from the person. This allows you to handle the needle safely, without the risk of exposing yourself to blood or body fluids. If you are using this kind of needle, make sure you know how it works before you use it.  Follow these guidelines when you work with sharps.  - DO NOT uncover or unwrap the sharp object until it is time to use it.  - Keep the object pointed away from yourself and other people at all times.  - Never recap or bend a sharp object.  - Keep your fingers away from the tip of the object.  - If the object is reusable, put it in a secure, closed container after you use it.  - Never hand a sharp object to someone else or put it on a tray for another person to pick up.  - Tell the people you are working with when you plan to set the object down or pick it up.\\n\\nSharps Disposal : Make sure the disposal container is made for disposing of sharp objects. Replace containers when they are two-thirds full.  Other important tips include:  - Never put your fingers into the sharps container.  - If the needle has tubing attached to it, hold the needle and the tubing when you put it in the sharps container.  - Sharps containers should be at eye level and within your reach.  - If a needle is sticking out of the container, do not push it in with your hands. Call to have the container removed. Or, a trained person may use tongs to push the needle back into the container.  - If you find an uncovered sharp object outside of a disposal container, it is safe to pick it up only if you can grasp the non-sharp end. If you cannot, use tongs to pick it up and dispose of it.) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Test/procedure preparation - infant; Preparing infant for test/procedure)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002055.htm\\nAnswer: Be aware that your child will likely cry, and restraints may be used. The most important way you can help your infant through this procedure is by being there and showing you care.  Crying is a normal response to the strange environment, unfamiliar people, restraints, and separation from you. Your infant will cry more for these reasons than because the test or procedure is uncomfortable.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Infants lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children usually have. Restraints may be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your infant's safety. For example, in order to get clear test results on an x-ray, there cannot be any movement. Your infant may be restrained by hand or with physical devices.  If blood needs to be taken or an IV started, restraints are important in preventing injury to your infant. If your infant moves while the needle is being inserted, the needle could damage a blood vessel, bone, tissue, or nerves.  Your provider will use every means to ensure the safety and comfort of your baby. Beside restraints, other measures include medications, observation, and monitors.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your infant during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or your health care provider's office, you will likely be able to be present.  If you are not asked to be by your infant's side and would like to be, ask your provider if this is possible. If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but staying in your infant's line of vision. If you are not able to be present, leaving a familiar object with your infant may be comforting.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  - Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, since this can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your child perform the procedure.  - Ask that anesthetics be used if appropriate to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be done in the hospital crib, so that the infant does not come to associate pain with the crib. Many hospitals have special treatment rooms where procedures are done.  - Imitate the behavior you or your health care provider need the infant to do, such as opening the mouth.  - Many children's hospitals have child life specialists who are specially trained to educate patients and families and advocate for them during procedures. Ask if such a person is available.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Preparing preschoolers for test/procedure; Test/procedure preparation - preschooler)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002057.htm\\nAnswer: Preparing children for medical tests can reduce their distress. It can also make them less likely to cry and resist the procedure. Research shows that lowering anxiety can decrease the sensation of pain people feel during uncomfortable procedures. Even so, being prepared may not change the fact that your child will feel some discomfort or pain.  Before the test, understand that your child will probably cry. Demonstrate in advance what will happen during the test to learn about your child\\'s fears and concerns. Using a doll or other object to act out the test may reveal worries your child may not be able to talk about, and may reduce your child\\'s anxiety.  Most people are frightened of the unknown. It helps if your child knows what to expect. If your child\\'s fears are not realistic, explaining what will actually happen can help. If your child is worried about a part of the test, do not minimize this concern. Reassure your child that you will be there to help as much as you can.  Make sure your child understands that the procedure is not a punishment. Preschool-age children may believe that the pain they feel is a punishment for something they did.  The most important way you can help your child is to prepare properly, and provide support and comfort around the time of the procedure. Ask if the hospital has a child life specialist who can help you before and after the procedure.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE:  Keep your explanations about the procedure to 10 or 15 minutes. Preschoolers have a limited attention span. Explain the test or procedure right before it takes place so that your child doesn\\'t worry about it for days or weeks in advance.  Here are some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:  - Explain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words and avoiding abstract terms.  - Use play preparation to demonstrate the procedure to your child and identify concerns (see the next section).  - Make sure your child understands the body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.  - Describe as best as you can how the test will feel.  - Be honest with your child about any discomfort or pain the test may cause.  - If the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.  - Give your child permission to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words.  - Ask if your child has questions about something you have explained.  - Allow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be required for the particular procedure, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  - Stress the benefits of the procedure and talk about things the child may enjoy after the test, such as feeling better or going home. You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of \"being good\" for the test.  - Practice deep breathing and other comforting activities with your child. If possible, have your child hold your hand and squeeze it when feeling pain.  - Ask the health care provider if your child can make some decisions, when appropriate, such as which arm should have the IV or what color bandage to use.  - Distract your child during and after the procedure with books, songs, counting, deep breathing, or blowing bubbles.    PLAY PREPARATION  Play can be a wonderful way to demonstrate the procedure for your child and identify any anxiety your child may have. Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.  Many young children have a favorite toy or other important object that can be a tool for a process called third-party communication. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the toy or object instead of directly. For example, a child who is about to have blood drawn may be better able to understand if you discuss how the \"doll might feel\" during the test.  Toys or dolls can help you explain the procedure to your preschooler. Once you are familiar with the procedure, briefly demonstrate on the toy what your child will experience. Using the toy, show your child:  - Bandages  - How injections are given  - How IVs are inserted  - How surgical cuts are made  - Stethoscopes  - What positions your child will be in    After your demonstration, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp items). Watch your child for clues about concerns or fears.  No matter what test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange environment, unfamiliar people, and separation from you. Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Your child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear results with x-rays there must not be any movement.   Restraints may also be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your child\\'s safety. Restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff temporarily have to leave the room during x-ray and nuclear studies. They may also be used when a puncture is done to get a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.  Your child\\'s health care provider will use every method to make sure your child is safe and comfortable. Besides restraints, other measures include medications, monitors, and observation.  Your job as a parent is to comfort your child.  DURING THE PROCEDURE:  Your presence may help your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or at your child\\'s health care provider\\'s office, you may be able to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.  If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay were your child can see you. If youcannot be present, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.  Avoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child feel more upset. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety. If you are feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help. They can provide child care for other siblings or meals for the family so you can focus on supporting your child.   Other considerations:  - Ask your child\\'s health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, because this can raise anxiety.  - Ask if the provider who has spent the most time with your child can be present during the procedure.  - Ask if anesthesia can be used, if appropriate, to reduce your child\\'s discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be performed in the hospital bed, so that the child does not link pain with the hospital room.  - If your child can see you during the procedure, do what your child is told to do, such as opening your mouth.  - Ask if a low sensory environment can be created.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007609.htm\\nAnswer: What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.  Shingles is far more common in people 50 years of age and older than in younger people. It is also more common in people whose immune systems are weakened because of a disease such as cancer, or drugs such as steroids or chemotherapy.  At least 1 million people a year in the United States get shingles. Shingles vaccine  A vaccine for shingles was licensed in 2006. In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by 50%. It can also reduce pain in people who still get shingles after being vaccinated.  A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years of age and older. Some people should not get shingles vaccine or should wait.  A person should not get shingles vaccine who:  - Has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.  - Has a weakened immune system because of current:        - AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system,    - Treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids,    - Cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy,    - Cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma.      - Is pregnant, or might be pregnant. Women should not become pregnant until at least 4 weeks after getting shingles vaccine.    Someone with a minor acute illness, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But anyone with a moderate or severe acute illness should usually wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. This includes anyone with a temperature of 101.3F or higher. What are the risks from shingles vaccine?  A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. However, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.  No serious problems have been identified with shingles vaccine.  Mild problems  - Redness, soreness, swelling, or itching at the site of the injection (about 1 person in 3).  - Headache (about 1 person in 70).    Like all vaccines, shingles vaccine is being closely monitored for unusual or severe problems. What if there is a serious reaction?  What should I look for?  - Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes.    Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.   What should I do?  - If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor.  - Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the VAERS website or by calling 1-800-822-7967.    VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.

(Also called: Preparing toddler for test/procedure; Test/procedure preparation - toddler; Preparing for a medical test or procedure - toddler)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002056.htm\\nAnswer: Before the test, know that your child will probably cry. Even if you prepare, your child may feel some discomfort or pain. Try using play to show your child what will happen during the test. Doing so may help you learn your child\\'s concerns. The most important way you can help your child is by preparing ahead of time and providing support at the time of the test.  PREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE  Limit your explanations about the procedure to 5 or 10 minutes. Toddlers have a short attention span. Any preparation should take place right before the test or procedure.  Some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:  - Explain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words. Avoid abstract terms.  - Make sure your child understands the exact body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.  - Try to describe how the test will feel.  - If the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.  - Give your child permission to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words. Encourage your child to tell you where the pain is located.  - Allow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be needed for the procedure, such as the fetal position for a lumbar puncture.  - Stress the benefits of the procedure. Talk about things that the child may find pleasurable after the test, such as feeling better or going home. You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of \"being good\" for the test.  - Allow your child to make simple choices, such as what color bandage to use after the procedure.  - Distract your child with books, songs, or a simple activity such as blowing bubbles.    PLAY PREPARATION  Play can be a wonderful way to demonstratethe procedure for your child and identify any anxiety your child may have. Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.  Many young children have a favorite toy or important object that can be used to explain the test. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the object. For example, a child may be able to understand a blood test if you discuss how the \"doll might feel\" during the test.  Toys or dolls can also help you explain the procedure to your toddler. These visual examples can take the place of unfamiliar words for younger children with a limited vocabulary.  Once you know how the procedure will be done, briefly demonstrate what your child will experience on the toy. Show the body positions the child will be in, where bandages and stethoscopes will be placed, how incisions are made, how injections are given, and how IVs are inserted. After your demonstration, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp objects). Watch your child for clues about concerns and fears.  No matter which test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange environment, unfamiliar people, and separation from you. Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Your child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children do not have the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear x-ray results, the child cannot move.   Restraints may also be used to make sure your child is safe during a procedure or other situation. For example, restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff have to temporarily leave the room during x-ray and nuclear studies. Restraints may also be used to hold your child still while the skin is punctured to obtain a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.  Your child\\'s health care provider will to everything possible to make sure your child is safe and comfortable. Besides restraints, other measures include medications, monitors, and observation.  Your job as a parent is to comfort your child.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at a hospital or at your child\\'s health care provider\\'s office, you will most likely be allowed to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.  If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay where your child can still see you. If you cannot be there, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.  Avoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child more nervous. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.   If you are feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help. They can provide child care for other siblings or meals for the family so you can focus on supporting your child.   Other considerations:  - Your child will probably resist the procedure and may even try to run away. A firm, direct approach from you and the health care staff may be helpful.  - Give one direction at a time during the procedure, using 1- or 2-word commands.  - Avoid covering your child\\'s face.  - Ask your child\\'s health care provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, because this can raise anxiety.  - Ask if the provider who has spent the most time with your child can be present during the procedure.  - Ask if anesthesia can be used, if appropriate, to reduce your child\\'s discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be performed in the crib, so that your child does not link pain with the crib.  - If your child can see you during the procedure, do what your child is told to do, such as opening your mouth.  - Use your child\\'s normal sense of curiosity as a distraction during the procedure.  - Ask if a low sensory environment can be created.) \\n',\n",

       " \"Question: What is (are) Shingles vaccine - what you need to know ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007609.htm\\nAnswer: What is shingles?  Shingles is a painful skin rash, often with blisters. It is also called Herpes Zoster, or just Zoster.  A shingles rash usually appears on one side of the face or body and lasts from 2 to 4 weeks. Its main symptom is pain, which can be quite severe. Other symptoms of shingles can include fever, headache, chills and upset stomach. Very rarely, a shingles infection can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitits) or death.  For about 1 person in 5, severe pain can continue even long after the rash clears up. This is called post-herpetic neuralgia.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox.  Only someone who has had chickenpox -- or, rarely, has gotten chickenpox vaccine -- can get shingles. The virus stays in your body, and can cause shingles many years later.  You can't catch shingles from another person with shingles. However, a person who has never had chickenpox (or chickenpox vaccine) could get chickenpox from someone with shingles. This is not very common.

       " 'Question: How to prevent Shingles ?\\nURL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html\\nAnswer: Yes. In May 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine, called Zostavax, is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. The shingles vaccine is NOT recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. (Watch the video to learn more about shingles treatments.

       " \"Question: What causes Shingles ?\\nURL: http://nihseniorhealth.gov/shingles/toc.html\\nAnswer: Caused By A Virus Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox, the sores healed and the other symptoms went away, but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells, usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow, the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again, it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine, continues around one side of the body, and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age, our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer, radiation treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks, shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children, immune deficiency is the primary risk factor, but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly, that exposure apparently boosted the adult's immunity, which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life.) \\n\",\n",

The virus can become active again, especially in the later years of your life when your immune system doesn't protect you as well from infections. The virus travels from the spinal nerve cells and follows a nerve path out to the skin. Nerve endings in the skin become inflamed and erupt in a very painful rash.

The first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain (which can be severe), or sometimes numbness or itch,generally on one side of the body. After several days or a week, a rash of fluid-filled blisters, similar to chickenpox, appears in one area on one side of the body. Shingles pain can be mild or intense. Some people have mostly itching; some feel pain from the gentlest touch or breeze. The most common location for shingles is a band, called a dermatome, spanning one side of the trunk around the waistline. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. Scientists think that some of the virus particles from the original exposure to the varicella-zoster virus,leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system.

The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages: severe pain or tingling, possibly itchy rash, and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus, (Another name for shingles is herpes zoster.) Once you are infected with this kind of virus, it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash, even after the rash clears up. In most patients, the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months, but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact, one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older, they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected.  -  Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring.

Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However, a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition, you can receive the shingles vaccine. (See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention.) Is Shingles Contagious? Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases, the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox, but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles, - keep the rash covered  - avoid touching or scratching the rash  - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.  keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus.

Bilirubin can also be measured with a urine test.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : You should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the test. Your health care provider may instruct you to stop taking medicines that affect the test.  Many drugs may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : A small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.  A high level of bilirubin in the blood can lead to jaundice. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.  Jaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level. The test will likely be ordered when:  - The provider is concerned about a newborn's jaundice (most newborns have some jaundice)  - Jaundice develops in older infants, children, and adults   A bilirubin test is also ordered when the provider suspects a person has liver or gallbladder problems.\\n\\nNormal Results : It is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. A normal level is:  - Direct (also called conjugated) bilirubin: 0 to 0.3 mg/dL  - Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL   Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : In newborns, bilirubin level is higher for the first few days of life. Your child's provider must consider the following when deciding whether your baby's bilirubin level is too high:  - How fast the level has been rising  - Whether the baby was born early  - The baby's age   Jaundice can also occur when more red blood cells than normal are broken down. This can be caused by:  - A blood disorder called erythroblastosis fetalis  - A red blood cell disorder called hemolytic anemia  - Transfusion reaction in which red blood cells that were given in a transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system   The following liver problems may also cause jaundice or a high bilirubin level:  - Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)  - Swollen and inflamed liver (hepatitis)  - Other liver disease  - Disorder in which bilirubin is not processed normally by the liver (Gilbert disease)   The following problems with gallbladder or bile ducts may cause higher bilirubin levels:  - Abnormal narrowing of the common bile duct (biliary stricture)  - Cancer of the pancreas or gallbladder  - Gallstones) \\n\",\n",
       " 'Question: Do you have information about CPR - adult and child 9 years and older (Also called: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - adult; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - adult; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - adult; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation - child 9 years and older; Rescue breathing and chest compressions - child 9 years and older; Resuscitation - cardiopulmonary - child 9 years and older)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000013.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Itis a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone\\'s breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after anelectric shock, drowning, or heart attack. CPR involves:  - Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a person\\'s lungs.  - Chest compressions, which keep the person\\'s blood circulating.   Permanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a person\\'s blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the person\\'s heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\\n\\nConsiderations : CPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training. The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-standing practice. See www.americanheart.org for classes near you.  Time is very important when an unconscious person is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.  Machines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. When using an AED, follow the instructions exactly.\\n\\nCauses : In adults, major reasons that heartbeat and breathing stop include:  - Drug overdose   - Excessive bleeding   - Heart problem (heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm, fluid in the lungs or compressing the heart)   - Infection in the bloodstream (sepsis)   - Injuries and accidents  - Drowning  - Stroke There are many things that cause an older child or teen\\'s heartbeat and breathing to stop, including:  - Choking  - Drowning  - Electrical shock  - Excessive bleeding  - Head trauma or serious injury  - Lung disease  - Poisoning  - Suffocation\\n\\nSymptoms : CPR should be done if a person has any of the following symptoms:  - No breathing or difficulty breathing (gasping)  - No pulse  - Unconsciousness\\n\\nFirst Aid : 1. Check for responsiveness. Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise. Shout, \"Are you okay?\"  2. Call 911 if there is no response. Shout for help and send someone to call 911. If you are alone, call 911 and retrieve an AED (if available), even if you have to leave the person.  3. Carefully place the person on the back.  If there is a chance the person has a spinal injury, two people should move the person to prevent the head and neck from twisting.  4. Perform chest compressions:  - Place the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- right between the nipples.  - Place the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand.  - Position your body directly over your hands.  - Give 30 chest compressions. These compressions should be fast and hard. Press down about 2 inches into the chest. Each time, let the chest rise completely. Count the 30 compressions quickly: \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off\".   5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with two fingers. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.  6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the person\\'s mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.  7. If the person is not breathing or has trouble breathing:  - Cover their mouth tightly with your mouth.  - Pinch the nose closed.  - Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.  - Give two rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.   8. Repeat chest compressions and rescue breathing until the person recovers or help arrives. If an AED for adults is available, use it as soon as possible.  If the person starts breathing again, place him or her in the recovery position. Keep checking for breathing until help arrives.\\n\\nDO NOT : - If the person has normal breathing, coughing, or movement,do NOT begin chest compressions. Doing so may cause the heart to stop beating.   - Unless you are a health professional,do NOT check for a pulse. Only a health care professional is properly trained to check for a pulse.\\n\\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional : - If you have help, tell one person to call 911 while another person begins CPR.  - If you are alone, as soon as you determine that the person is unresponsive, call 911 immediately. Then begin CPR.\\n\\nPrevention : In adults, to avoid injuries and heart problems that can lead to the heart stopping beating:  - Eliminate or reduce risk factors that contribute to heart disease, such as cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and stress.  - Get plenty of exercise.  - See your health care provider regularly.  - Always use seat belts and drive safely.  - Avoid using illegal drugs. Most children need CPR because of a preventable accident. The following tips may help prevent some accidents in children:  - Teach your children the basic principles of family safety.  - Teach your child to swim.  - Teach your child to watch for cars and ride bikes safely.  - Teach your child firearm safety. If you have guns in your home, keep them locked in an isolated cabinet.) \\n',\n",

Female reproductive organs include the vagina, ovaries, uterus, and cervix.) \\n\",\n",
       " \"Question: What causes Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001497.htm\\nAnswer: A baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This development continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.  The development is a complex process. Many different things can interrupt the process. How severe your baby's problem is depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, the earlier development problems occur in the womb, the more serious the problem.  Problems in the development of a girl's reproductive organs may be caused by:  - Broken or missing genes (genetic defect)  - Use of certain drugs during pregnancy   For example, some babies may have a genetic defect that prevents their body from producing a substance called 21-hydroxylase. If a developing baby girl lacks this substance, she will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, but her external genitals will look like those found on boys. See: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia  Certain drugs that the mother takes can pass into the baby's bloodstream and interfere with organ development. One drug known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Doctors once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that baby girls born to women who took this drug had an abnormally shaped uterus. The drug also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.  Sometimes, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the girl is older.  The reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas, including the urinary tract, kidneys, and lower spine.  Developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include intersex and ambiguous genitalia. See the specific articles for information on these conditions.  Other developmental disorders of the female reproductive tract include:  - Cloacal abnormalities -- The cloaca is a tube-like structure. In the early stages of a baby's development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this one tube. But, later in development, the three areas separate and have their own openings. If the cloaca persists as a baby girl grows in the womb, all the openings do not form. For example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. Urine and feces cannot drain out of the body. This can cause severe pain, stomach swelling, and breathing problems. Some cloacal abnormalities may cause a baby girl to look like she has a male's penis. These birth defects are rare.  - Problems with outer (external) genitals -- Developmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia (when the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together). Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to intersex or ambiguous genitalia.  - Imperforate hymen -- The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. This often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. Sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny small holes. This problem may not be discovered until puberty. Some baby girls are born without a hymen.  - Ovarian problems -- A baby girl may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.  - Uterus and cervix problems-- A baby girl may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, girls born with half a uterus and half a vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body.  - Vaginal problems-- A baby girl may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kster-Hauser syndrome. In this syndrome, the baby is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs (uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes). Other abnormalities include having two vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract, a heart shaped uterus, and a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity) \\n\",\n",

People with this condition typically are tall with long limbs (dolichostenomelia) and long, slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly). They often have permanently bent joints (contractures) that can restrict movement in their hips, knees, ankles, or elbows. Additional features of congenital contractural arachnodactyly include underdeveloped muscles, a rounded upper back that also curves to the side (kyphoscoliosis), permanently bent fingers and toes (camptodactyly), ears that look \"crumpled,\" and a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Rarely, people with congenital contractural arachnodactyly have heart defects such as an enlargement of the blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (aortic root dilatation) or a leak in one of the valves that control blood flow through the heart (mitral valve prolapse). The life expectancy of individuals with congenital contractural arachnodactyly varies depending on the severity of symptoms but is typically not shortened.

It is characterized by mildly unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, bleeding problems, skeletal malformations, and many other signs and symptoms.  People with Noonan syndrome have distinctive facial features such as a deep groove in the area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), widely spaced eyes that are usually pale blue or blue-green in color, and low-set ears that are rotated backward. Affected individuals may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth (high-arched palate), poor alignment of the teeth, and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). Many children with Noonan syndrome have a short neck and both children and adults may have excess neck skin (also called webbing) and a low hairline at the back of the neck.  Approximately 50 to 70 percent of individuals with Noonan syndrome have short stature. At birth, they are usually of normal length and weight, but growth slows over time. Abnormal levels of growth hormone may contribute to the slow growth.  Individuals with Noonan syndrome often have either a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum). Some affected people may also have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).  Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart defect. The most common heart defect is a narrowing of the valve that controls blood flow from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary valve stenosis). Some affected individuals have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood.  A variety of bleeding disorders have been associated with Noonan syndrome. Some people may have excessive bruising, nosebleeds, or prolonged bleeding following injury or surgery. Women with a bleeding disorder typically have excessive bleeding during menstruation (menorrhagia) or childbirth.  Adolescent males with Noonan syndrome typically experience delayed puberty. Affected individuals go through puberty starting at age 13 or 14 and have a reduced pubertal growth spurt. Most males with Noonan syndrome have undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), which may be related to delayed puberty or to infertility (inability to father a child) later in life. Females with Noonan syndrome typically have normal puberty and fertility.  Noonan syndrome can cause a variety of other signs and symptoms. Most children diagnosed with Noonan syndrome have normal intelligence, but a small percentage has special educational needs, and some have intellectual disability. Some affected individuals have vision or hearing problems. Infants with Noonan syndrome may be born with puffy hands and feet caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), which can go away on its own. Affected infants may also have feeding problems, which typically get better by age 1 or 2. Older individuals can also develop lymphedema, usually in the ankles and lower legs.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: What are the treatments for Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder ?\\nURL: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/adhd/adhd.htm\\nAnswer: The usual course of treatment may include medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) or dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), which are stimulants that decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity and increase attention. Most experts agree that treatment for ADHD should address multiple aspects of the individual's functioning and should not be limited to the use of medications alone. Treatment should include structured classroom management, parent education (to address discipline and limit-setting), and tutoring and/or behavioral therapy for the child.) \\n\",\n",

       " \"Question: What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome\\nAnswer: Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.  A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age.  Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome)\\nURL: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/antiphospholipid-syndrome\\nAnswer: The genetic cause of antiphospholipid syndrome is unknown. This condition is associated with the presence of three abnormal immune proteins (antibodies) in the blood: lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I. Antibodies normally bind to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction, but the antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome attack normal human proteins. When these antibodies attach (bind) to proteins, the proteins change shape and bind to other molecules and receptors on the surface of cells. Binding to cells, particularly immune cells, turns on (activates) the blood clotting pathway and other immune responses.  The production of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-B2 glycoprotein I may coincide with exposure to foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, that are similar to normal human proteins. Exposure to these foreign invaders may cause the body to produce antibodies to fight the infection, but because the invaders are so similar to the body's own proteins, the antibodies also attack the human proteins. Similar triggers may occur during pregnancy when a woman's physiology, particularly her immune system, adapts to accommodate the developing fetus. These changes during pregnancy may explain the high rate of affected females.  Certain genetic variations (polymorphisms) in a few genes have been found in people with antiphospholipid syndrome and may predispose individuals to produce the specific antibodies known to contribute to the formation of thromboses. However, the contribution of these genetic changes to the development of the condition is unclear.  People who test positive for all three antibodies but have not had a thrombosis or recurrent miscarriages are said to be antiphospholipid carriers. These individuals are at greater risk of developing a thrombosis than is the general population.) \\n\",\n",

This is very common among women of childbearing age.   - These secretions may turn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  - The amount of mucus produced varies during the menstrual cycle as hormone levels in the body change.    The following factors can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:  - Feeling stressed  - Ovulation (the production and release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of your menstrual cycle)  - Pregnancy  - Sexual excitement    Different types of infections may cause itching or a discharge in the vagina. These include:  - Infections spread during sexual contact. These include chlamydia, gonorrhea (GC), and trichomoniasis.  - Vaginal yeast infection, caused by a fungus.  - Normal bacteria that live in the vagina that overgrow, causing a gray discharge and fishy odor. This is called bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is not often spread through sexual contact.    Other causes of vaginal discharge and itching may be:  - Menopause and low estrogen levels, which may lead to vaginal dryness and other symptoms (Atrophic vaginitis).  - Forgotten tampon or foreign body, which may cause a foul odor.  - Chemicals found in detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies orcreams, which may irritate the vagina or the skin around the vagina   Less common causes include:  - Cancer of the cervix or vagina   - Skin conditions, such as desquamative vaginitis and lichen planus) \\n',\n",

(Also called: Pruritus vulvae; Itching - vaginal area; Vulvar itching)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003158.htm\\nAnswer: Keep your genital area clean and dry when you have vaginitis.   - Avoid soap and just rinse with water to clean yourself.   - Soak in a warm, not hot, bath may help your symptoms. Dry thoroughly afterward.   Avoid douching. Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.   Other tips are:   - Avoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.   - Use pads and not tampons while you have an infection.   - If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar levels in good control.   Allow more air to reach your genital area. You can do this by:   - Wearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose   - Wearing cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.   - Not wearing underwear at night when you sleep.   Girls and women should also:   - Know how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.   - Wipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.   - Wash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.

       " 'Question: How should Methadone be used and what is the dosage ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682134.html\\nAnswer: Methadone comes as a tablet, a dispersible (can be dissolved in liquid) tablet , a solution (liquid), and a concentrated solution to take by mouth. When methadone is used to relieve pain, it may be taken every 8 to 12 hours. If you take methadone as part of a treatment program, your doctor will prescribe the dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methadone exactly as directed.  If you are using the dispersible tablets, do not chew or swallow before mixing the tablet in a liquid. If your doctor has told you to take only part of a tablet, break the tablet carefully along the lines that have been scored into it. Place the tablet or piece of the tablet in at least 120 mL (4 ounces) of water, orange juice, Tang, citrus flavors of Kool-Aid, or a citrus fruit drink to dissolve. Drink the entire mixture right away. If some tablet residue remains in the cup after you drink the mixture, add a small amount of liquid to the cup and drink it all.  Your doctor may change your dose of methadone during your treatment. Your doctor may decrease your dose or tell you to take methadone less often as your treatment continues. If you experience pain during your treatment, your doctor may increase your dose or may prescribe an additional medication to control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with methadone. Do not take extra doses of methadone or take doses of methadone earlier than they are scheduled even if you experience pain.  Do not stop taking methadone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking methadone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, muscle pain, widened pupils (black circles in the middle of the eyes), irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea.) \\n',\n",

An example of fine motor control is picking up a small item with the index finger (pointer finger or forefinger) and thumb.  The opposite of fine motor control is gross (large, general) motor control. An example of gross motor control is waving an arm in greeting.  Problems of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves (nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord), muscles, or joints may all decrease fine motor control. People with Parkinson disease have trouble speaking, eating, and writing because they have lost fine motor control.  The amount of fine motor control in children is used to figure out the child's developmental age. Children develop fine motor skills over time, by practicing and being taught. To have fine motor control, children need:  - Awareness and planning  - Coordination  - Muscle strength  - Normal sensation    The following tasks can only occur if the nervous system develops in the right way:  - Cutting out shapes with scissors  - Drawing lines or circles  - Folding clothes  - Holding and writing with a pencil  - Stacking blocks  - Zipping a zipper) \\n\",\n",

It may be due to problems in the woman, man, or both.  FEMALE INFERTILITY  Female infertility may occur when:  - A fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).  - The fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.  - The eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.  - The ovaries have problems producing eggs.    Female infertility may be caused by:   - Autoimmune disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  - Birth defects that affect the reproductive tract  - Cancer or tumor  - Clotting disorders  - Diabetes  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Exercising too much  - Eating disorders or poor nutrition  - Growths (such as fibroids or polyps) in the uterus and cervix  - Medicines such as chemotherapy drugs  - Hormone imbalances  - Obesity  - Older age  - Ovarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)  - Pelvic infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infection, abdominal surgery or endometriosis  - Smoking  - Surgery to prevent pregnancy (tubal ligation) or failure of tubal ligation reversal (reanastomosis)  - Thyroid disease    MALE INFERTILITY  Male infertility may be due to:  - Decreased number of sperm  - Blockage that prevents the sperm from being released  - Defects in the sperm    Male infertility can be caused by:  - Birth defects  - Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation  - Exposure to high heat for prolonged periods  - Heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine  - Hormone imbalance  - Impotence  - Infection  - Medicines such as cimetidine, spironolactone, and nitrofurantoin  - Obesity  - Older age  - Retrograde ejaculation  - Scarring from sexually transmitted infections, injury, or surgery  - Smoking  - Toxins in the environment  - Vasectomy or failure of vasectomy reversal    Healthy couples under age 30 who have sex regularly will have a 25 to 30% per month chance of getting pregnant each month.  A woman is most fertile in her early 20s. The chance a woman can get pregnant drops greatly after age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.  Infertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 year of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This will help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option, but for women who know they will need to delay childbearing, it may be worth considering.) \\n\",\n",

(Also called: Inability to conceive; Unable to get pregnant)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001191.htm\\nAnswer: Treatment depends on the cause of infertility. It may involve:  - Education and counseling about the condition  - Fertility treatments such as intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF)  - Medicines to treat infections and clotting disorders  - Medicines that help the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries   Couples can increase the chances of becoming pregnant each month by having sex at least every 3 days before and during ovulation.   Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks before the next menstrual cycle (period) starts. Therefore, if a woman gets her period every 28 days the couple should have sex at least every 3 days between the 10th and 18th day after her period starts.  Having sex before ovulation occurs is especially helpful.   - Sperm can live inside a woman's body for at least 3 days.   - However, a woman's egg can only be fertilized by the sperm for a few hours after it is released.    Women who are under or overweight, may increase their chances of becoming pregnant by getting to a healthier weight.) \\n\",\n",

       " 'Question: Do you have information about Lymph node biopsy (Also called: Biopsy - lymph nodes; Open lymph node biopsy; Fine needle aspiration biopsy; Sentinel lymph node biopsy)\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003933.htm\\nAnswer: Summary : A lymph node biopsy is the removal of lymph node tissue for examination under a microscope.  The lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection. Canceroften spreads to lymph nodes.\\n\\nHow the Test is Performed : A lymph node biopsy is done in an operating room in a hospital. Or, it is done at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.  An open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node:   - You lie on the examination table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy.  - The biopsy site is cleansed.  - The health care provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the area. Sometimes, general anesthesia is used, which means you are asleep and pain-free.  - A small surgical cut (incision)is made. The lymph node or part of the node is removed.   - Theincision is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied.  - An open biopsy may take 30to 45 minutes.   For some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinal lymph node biopsy, and it involves:  - A tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye, is injected at the tumor site.  - The tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node. This node is called the sentinel node.It is the first lymph node to whicha cancer spreads.  - The sentinel node and possibly one or two other lymph nodes are removed.   The sample is then sent to the laboratory for examination.  A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into a lymph node. This type of biopsy is done less often because the results are not as helpful as with an open biopsy.\\n\\nHow to Prepare for the Test : Tell your health care provider:  - If you are pregnant  - If you have any drug allergies  - If you have bleeding problems  - What medications you are taking (including any supplements or herbal remedies)   Your doctor may ask you to:  - Stop taking any blood thinners, such as aspirin, heparin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix) 5to 10 days before the procedure  - Not eat or drink anything after a certain period of time before the biopsy  - Arrive at a certain time for the procedure   You must sign a consent form.\\n\\nHow the Test will Feel : When the local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging. The biopsy site will be sore for a few days after the test.  After an open biopsy, the pain is mild and you can easily control it with an over-the-counter pain medication. You may also notice some bruising or fluid leaking for a few days. Theincision should heal in 10to 14 days. Follow instructions for taking care of the incision.While the incision is healing, avoid any type of intense exercise or heavy lifting.\\n\\nWhy the Test is Performed : The test is used to diagnose cancer, sarcoidosis,or an infection (such as tuberculosis):  - When you or your doctor feel swollen glands and they do not go away  - When lymph nodes are present on a CT or MRI scan  - For some patients with breast cancer or melanoma, to see if the cancer has spread (sentinel lymph node biopsy)    The results of the biopsy help your doctor decide on further tests and treatments.\\n\\nNormal Results : If a lymph node biopsy does not show any signs of cancer, it is more likely that other lymph nodes nearby are also cancer-free. This information can help the health care provider decide about further tests and treatments.\\n\\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may be due to many different conditions, from very mild infections to cancer.  For example, enlarged lymph nodes may be due to:  - Cancers (breast, lung, oral)  - HIV  - Hodgkin lymphoma  - Infection (tuberculosis, cat scratch disease)  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  - Sarcoidosis\\n\\nRisks : - Bleeding  - Infection (in rare cases, the wound may get infected and you may need to take antibiotics)  - Nerve injury if the biopsy is done on a lymph node close to nerves (the numbness usually goes away in a few months)) \\n',\n",

Your doctor will prescribe a dosing schedule that is best for you. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylprednisolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.  Do not stop taking methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor. Stopping the drug abruptly can cause loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. If you take large doses for a long time, your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually to allow your body to adjust before stopping the drug completely. Watch for these side effects if you are gradually decreasing your dose and after you stop taking the tablets. If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of tablets temporarily or start taking them again.) \\n',\n",
       " \"Question: Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Methylprednisolone Oral ?\\nURL: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682795.html\\nAnswer: Before taking methylprednisolone,  - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to methylprednisolone, aspirin, tartrazine (a yellow dye in some processed foods and drugs), or any other drugs.  - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), arthritis medications, aspirin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), digoxin (Lanoxin), diuretics ('water pills'), erythromycin, estrogen (Premarin), ketoconazole (Nizoral), oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), rifampin (Rifadin), theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamins.  - if you have a fungal infection (other than on your skin), do not take methylprednisolone without talking to your doctor.  - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver, kidney, intestinal, or heart disease; diabetes; an underactive thyroid gland; high blood pressure; mental illness; myasthenia gravis; osteoporosis; herpes eye infection; seizures; tuberculosis (TB); or ulcers.  - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor.  - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking methylprednisolone.  - if you have a history of ulcers or take large doses of aspirin or other arthritis medication, limit your consumption of alcoholic beverages while taking this drug. Methylprednisolone makes your stomach and intestines more susceptible to the irritating effects of alcohol, aspirin, and certain arthritis medications.

Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to methylprednisolone. Checkups are especially important for children because methylprednisolone can slow bone growth.  If your condition worsens, call your doctor. Your dose may need to be adjusted.  Carry an identification card that indicates that you may need to take supplementary doses (write down the full dose you took before gradually decreasing it) of methylprednisolone during periods of stress (injuries, infections, and severe asthma attacks). Ask your pharmacist or doctor how to obtain this card. List your name, medical problems, drugs and dosages, and doctor's name and telephone number on the card.  This drug makes you more susceptible to illnesses. If you are exposed to chicken pox, measles, or tuberculosis (TB) while taking methylprednisolone, call your doctor. Do not have a vaccination, other immunization, or any skin test while you are taking methylprednisolone unless your doctor tells you that you may.  Report any injuries or signs of infection (fever, sore throat, pain during urination, and muscle aches) that occur during treatment.  Your doctor may instruct you to weigh yourself every day. Report any unusual weight gain.  If your sputum (the matter you cough up during an asthma attack) thickens or changes color from clear white to yellow, green, or gray, call your doctor; these changes may be signs of an infection.  If you have diabetes, methylprednisolone may increase your blood sugar level. If you monitor your blood sugar (glucose) at home, test your blood or urine more frequently than usual. Call your doctor if your blood sugar is high or if sugar is present in your urine; your dose of diabetes medication and your diet may need to be changed.  Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.  It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.) \\n\",\n",

Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about a third have vomiting.  Morning sickness usually begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week (3rd or 4th month). Some women have nausea and vomiting through their entire pregnancy.  Morning sickness does not hurt the baby in any way unless you lose weight, such as with severe vomiting. Mild weight loss during the first trimester is not uncommon when women have moderate symptoms, and is not harmful to the baby.  The amount of morning sickness during one pregnancy does not predict how you will feel in future pregnancies.) \\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** A fungal infection that often presents with ring-shaped rashes.\n",
    "* **Nummular eczema:** A type of eczema that causes coin-shaped, itchy patches of skin.\n",
    "* **Granuloma annulare:** A skin condition that causes raised, reddish or skin-colored bumps in a ring pattern.\n",
    "* **Erythema multiforme:** An allergic reaction that can cause target-shaped lesions.\n",

The lesion appears irregular in shape and texture.  Given its location and appearance, the following possibilities should be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seborrheic Keratosis:**  These are benign (non-cancerous) growths that are very common. They often appear waxy, stuck-on, and brown to black in color.\n",
    "* **Melanocytic Nevus (Mole):** Moles can vary in appearance from flat to raised, and in color from tan to dark brown or black.  While most moles are benign, changes in their appearance can sometimes be a sign of skin cancer.\n",
    "* **Dermatofibroma:** These are benign nodules that are firm to the touch and often have a dimple in the center. They are usually reddish-brown in color. \n",
    "* **Skin Tag (Acrochordon):** Skin tags are small, flesh-colored or brown growths that hang off the skin. They are benign and painless. \n",
    "* **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** While less likely in this location, basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can present as a pearly or waxy bump.  \"\"\",\n",

    "* **Seborrheic keratosis:** These are benign (non-cancerous) growths that are often brown, black, or light tan. They can appear waxy, scaly, or slightly raised. \n",
    "* **Melanocytic nevus (mole):** Moles are common growths on the skin that can vary in color, size, and shape. While most moles are benign, changes in size, color, or shape could indicate melanoma (skin cancer).\n",
    "* **Dermatofibroma:** These are harmless, firm nodules that are often brown, reddish, or pink. They typically develop on the legs or arms but can occur on the earlobe. \n",
    "* **Skin tag:** Skin tags are small, soft, flesh-colored growths that hang off the skin. While less common on the earlobe, they are possible. \n",
    "* **Melanoma:** Though less likely given the appearance, it's important to consider melanoma, a type of skin cancer, as a possibility, especially if the growth has changed recently. \"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"The image shows a close-up view of a skin lesion located on the scalp. The lesion is raised, flesh-colored to pink, and has a rough, irregular surface with a cobblestone-like appearance. There is some surrounding erythema (redness).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Seborrheic Keratosis:** This is a benign (non-cancerous) growth that is very common, especially in older individuals. They often have a \"stuck-on\" appearance and a waxy or scaly surface.\n",
    "* **Viral Wart (Verruca Vulgaris):** Warts can occur on the scalp and may have a rough, cauliflower-like appearance. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). \n",
    "* **Basal Cell Carcinoma:** While less likely given the appearance, this type of skin cancer can occur on the scalp and present as a pearly or waxy bump.\n",

    "\n",
    "Possible conditions that could cause these symptoms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scleroderma:** This autoimmune disease causes the body to produce too much collagen, leading to hardening and tightening of the skin. It can also affect internal organs.\n",
    "* **Graft-versus-host disease:** This complication can occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. The donor's immune cells attack the recipient's body, causing inflammation and damage to the skin, among other organs.\n",
    "* **Chronic venous insufficiency:** This condition occurs when the veins in the legs and hands have trouble sending blood back to the heart. This can cause fluid buildup, swelling, and skin changes.\n",
    "* **Acanthosis nigricans:** This skin condition causes dark, velvety patches of skin in body folds and creases, including the hands. It is often associated with insulin resistance and obesity.\n",
    "* **Porphyria cutanea tarda:** This rare genetic disorder affects the production of heme, a component of red blood cells. It can cause blisters, scarring, and skin thickening on sun-exposed areas, including the hands.\"\"\", \"\"\"The image shows a close-up view of the skin, potentially on the arm or torso.

    "\n",
    "* **Dermatofibroma:** These are benign skin growths that often appear as firm, reddish-brown nodules.\n",
    "* **Mole (Nevus):** Moles are common, benign skin growths that can vary in color, shape, and size.\n",
    "* **Basal Cell Carcinoma:**  While less likely in a lesion of this appearance, it's important to consider as it can present with a reddish, slightly raised appearance. \n",

    "\"\"\"The image shows a comparison of two skin conditions on what appears to be the back of a patient.  On the left is a brown, asymmetrical mole, which could indicate melanoma or dysplastic nevus. On the right is a round, hypopigmented patch that could be caused by tinea versicolor, vitiligo, or pityriasis alba. A dermatologist should evaluate these skin conditions for a proper diagnosis.\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"The image shows the lower body, specifically the legs and thighs, of an infant with dark skin. There are areas of erythema (redness) and scaling on the thighs. This could indicate a number of skin conditions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** A common condition causing red, itchy, and inflamed skin. \n",
    "* **Contact Dermatitis:** An allergic reaction or irritant reaction causing a red, itchy rash.\n",
    "* **Seborrheic Dermatitis:**  A common skin condition causing flaky, white to yellowish scales on oily areas, sometimes affecting infants.\n",
    "* **Psoriasis:**  While less common in infants, it can cause red, scaly patches.\n",
    "* **Fungal Infection:**  Certain fungal infections can cause red, itchy, and scaly rashes.\"\"\", \"\"\"The image shows a close-up view of a person's cheek, which is characterized by numerous small, scattered, dark bumps and pits. These are indicative of a skin condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible diseases that could cause these symptoms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acne:** Acne often manifests as pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads, but it can also leave behind pitted scars, particularly if it was severe or not treated properly. \n",
    "2. **Folliculitis:** This condition involves inflammation of hair follicles, leading to small, red bumps that may be itchy or painful. \n",
    "3. **Keratosis pilaris:** Often referred to as \"chicken skin,\" keratosis pilaris causes small, rough bumps due to a buildup of keratin in hair follicles. \n",
    "4. **Milia:** These are tiny white bumps that appear on the skin when dead skin cells become trapped beneath the surface.\n",
    "5. **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH):**  PIH is a common consequence of skin inflammation, particularly in people with darker skin tones. It can cause flat, brown spots where acne or other skin lesions have healed.\"\"\", \n",
    "\"\"\"The image shows a hand with multiple large, fluid-filled blisters (bullae) on the fingers and palm. The blisters are tense and appear to be filled with clear fluid. These characteristics suggest:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Second-degree burn:** The presence of large blisters and location on the hand suggest a burn, likely caused by heat. Second-degree burns affect the top two layers of skin.\n",
    "* **Friction burn:**  Similar in appearance to heat burns, friction burns result from rubbing or abrasion against a rough surface. \n",
    "* **Bullous impetigo:** While less likely, this bacterial infection can cause large, fluid-filled blisters. However, impetigo blisters often rupture easily. \n",
    "* **Allergic reaction:** Severe allergic reactions to certain substances can manifest as large blisters. \"\"\", \n",
    "\"\"\"The image shows the skin of a human face with multiple small black dots surrounded by red inflamed skin. Possible diseases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acne:** The presence of blackheads (open comedones) and inflamed papules point towards acne vulgaris.\n",
    "2. **Folliculitis:** This condition involves inflammation of hair follicles and can also present with blackheads and red bumps. \n",
    "3. **Keratosis pilaris:** While less likely due to the presence of blackheads, this condition causes rough patches and small bumps on the skin. \n",
    "4. **Contact dermatitis:** Although less likely, an allergic reaction or irritant could potentially cause similar skin changes.\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"The image shows a close-up view of a skin condition characterized by a large, raised, erythematous (red) lesion on the leg. The lesion appears to be filled with fluid or pus, suggesting an infection or inflammatory process. \n",

While this image doesn't show typical redness and swelling, some forms of otitis externa can present with scaling and debris.\\n* **Eczema:** This inflammatory skin condition can affect the ear canal, causing itching, redness, scaling, and cracking.\\n* **Psoriasis:** Another skin condition that can cause thick, scaly patches, although the appearance here isn't classic for psoriasis.\\n* **Fungal Infection (Otomycosis):**  The dark color and scaly appearance could indicate a fungal infection of the ear canal.\\n* **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** This common skin condition can cause flaky, white to yellowish scales, often on the scalp but it can affect areas like the ear canal. \\n* **Skin Cancer:** While less likely, any unusual lesion warrants investigation to rule out skin cancer. \", 'The image shows a single, well-defined, erythematous plaque on the leg.  The lesion is slightly raised and scaly.  Possible diagnoses include:\\n\\n* **Nummular eczema:** This is a common type of eczema that causes coin-shaped, itchy, and scaly patches of skin. \\n* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** This is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause red, ring-shaped rashes.\\n* **Psoriasis:**  This is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause thick, scaly, red patches of skin.\\n* **Drug eruption:** Some medications can cause a variety of skin reactions, including red, itchy rashes.']\n"
